When your words come true, we will honor you.\" ", "The Messenger of the LORD asked him, \"Why do you ask for my name? It's a name that works miracles.\" ", "So Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and sacrificed them to the LORD on a rock he used as an altar. While Manoah and his wife watched, the LORD did something miraculous. ", "As the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the Messenger of the LORD went up in the flame. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they immediately bowed down with their faces touching the ground. ", "The Messenger of the LORD didn't appear again to Manoah and his wife.

She was the one he wanted. ", "Later he went back to marry her. On his way he left the road to look at the lion he had killed. He saw a swarm of bees and some honey in the lion's dead body.

", "When her family saw him, they chose 30 of their friends to be with him. ", "Then Samson said to them, \"Let me tell you a riddle. If you solve it during the seven days of the party, I'll give you 30 linen shirts and 30 changes of clothes. ", "But if you can't solve it, you will give me the same things.\" They responded, \"Tell us your riddle! Let's hear it!\" ", "So Samson said to them, \"From the eater came something to eat. From the strong one came something sweet.\" For three days they couldn't solve the riddle. ", "On the fourth day they said to Samson's wife, \"Trick your husband into solving the riddle for us. If you don't, we'll burn you and your family to death. Did the two of you invite us just to make us poor?\" ", "So Samson's wife cried on his shoulder. She said, \"You hate me!

What is stronger than a lion?\" Samson replied, \"If you hadn't used my cow to plow, you wouldn't know my riddle now.\" ", "When the LORD's Spirit came over him, he went to Ashkelon and killed 30 men there. He took their clothes and gave them to the men who solved the riddle. He was angry, and he went to his father's house. ", "Samson's wife was given to his best man.

Isn't her younger sister better looking? Marry her instead!\" ", "Samson said to him, \"This time I won't be guilty when I get even with the Philistines, even though I'm going to do something terrible to them.\" ", "So Samson caught 300 foxes. He tied them together in pairs by their tails. Then he fastened a torch between their tails. ", "He set the torches on fire and released the foxes in the Philistines' grain fields. So he set fire to all their grain, whether it was stacked or in the fields. Their olive orchards also caught on fire. ", "Some Philistines asked, \"Who did this?\" They were told, \"Samson! He's the son-in-law of the man at Timnah. Samson did it because the man at Timnah took Samson's wife and gave her to his best man.\" So the Philistines burned Samson's wife and her father to death.

She tied Samson up with them. ", "Some men were hiding in the bedroom waiting for her to tie him up.

Now, tell me how you can be tied up.\" ", "Samson told her, \"If someone ties me up tightly with new ropes that have never been used, I will be like any other man.\" ", "So Delilah took some new ropes and tied him up with them.

You've made fun of me three times now, but you still haven't told me what makes you so strong.\" ", "Every day she made his life miserable with her questions. She pestered him until he wished he were dead. ", "Finally, he told her the truth. He told her, \"Because I'm a Nazirite, no one has ever cut the hair on my head.

He thought, \"I'll get out of this as usual and shake myself free.\" (He didn't realize that the LORD had left him.) ", "The Philistines grabbed him. They poked out his eyes and took him to the prison in Gaza. They tied him up with double chains and made him grind grain in the mill there.

Jonathan struck down the Philistines. His armorbearer, who was behind him, finished killing them.

But if it is in your people Israel, let him draw Thummim.\" Jonathan and Saul were chosen, and the people were freed from guilt. ", "\"Choose between me and my son Jonathan,\" Saul said. Then Jonathan was chosen. ", "\"Tell me,\" Saul asked Jonathan. \"What did you do?\" So Jonathan told him, \"I tasted a little honey on the tip of the staff I had in my hand.

He continued his journey, prophesying until he came to the pastures at Ramah. ", "He even took off his clothes as he prophesied in front of Samuel and lay there naked all day and all night. This is where the saying, \"Is Saul one of the prophets?\" came from.  "], ["David fled from the pastures at Ramah, came to Jonathan, and asked, \"What have I done? What crime am I guilty of? What sin have I committed against your father that he's trying to kill me?\" ", "Jonathan answered, \"That's unthinkable! You're not going to die! My father does nothing without telling me, whether it's important or not. Why should my father hide this from me? It's just not that way.\" ", "But David took an oath, saying, \"Your father certainly knows that you support me, so he said to himself, 'Jonathan must not know about this. It will bring him distress.'

After all, you forced me into an agreement with the LORD. If I have committed any crime, kill me yourself. Why bother taking me to your father?\"   ", "Jonathan answered, \"That's unthinkable! If I knew for sure that my father had decided to harm you, I would have told you about it.\" ", "Then David asked, \"Who will tell me whether or not your father gives you a harsh answer?\" ", "Jonathan said, \"Let's go out into the country.\" So they went out into the country. ", "\"As the LORD God of Israel is my witness,\" Jonathan continued, \"I'll find out in the next two or three days how my father feels about you. If he does feel kindly toward you, then I will send someone to tell you. ", "If my father plans to harm you and I fail to tell you and send you away safely, may the LORD harm me even more.

This is why he hasn't come to your banquet.\" ", "Then Saul got angry with Jonathan. \"Son of a crooked and rebellious woman!\" he called Jonathan. \"I know you've sided with Jesse's son. You have no shame. You act as if you are your mother's son but not mine. ", "As long as Jesse's son lives on earth, neither you nor your right to be king is secure.

Don't stand there!\" Jonathan's young servant gathered the arrows and came to his master. ", "The boy had no idea what was going on, but Jonathan and David understood.

He told the boy, \"Take them back into town.\" ", "When the boy had left, David came out from the south side of the rock and quickly bowed down three times with his face touching the ground.

", "\"Go in peace!\" Jonathan told David. \"We have both taken an oath in the LORD's name, saying, 'The LORD will be a witness between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever.'\" So David left, and Jonathan went into the city.  "], ["David went to the priest Ahimelech at Nob. Ahimelech was trembling as he went to meet David. \"Why are you alone?\" he asked David. \"Why is no one with you?\" ", "\"The king ordered me to do something,\" David answered the priest Ahimelech, \"and he told me, 'No one must know anything about this mission I'm sending you on and about the orders I've given you. I've stationed my young men at a certain place.'\" ", "David added, \"Now, what do you have to eat? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find.\" ", "\"I don't have any ordinary bread,\" the chief priest answered David. \"But there is holy bread for the young men if they haven't had sexual intercourse today.\" ", "David answered the priest, \"Of course women have been kept away from us as usual when we go on a mission. The young men's bodies are kept holy even on ordinary campaigns. How much more then will their bodies be holy today?\" ", "So the priest gave him holy bread because he only had the bread of the presence which had been taken from the LORD's presence and replaced with warm bread that day.

I didn't take either my spear or any other weapon because the king's business was urgent.\" ", "The chief priest answered, \"The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Elah Valley, is here. It is wrapped in a cloth behind the priestly ephod. If you want to take it, take it. There's no other weapon here.\" David said, \"There's none like it. Let me have the sword.\"   ", "That day David left. He was still fleeing from Saul when he came to King Achish of Gath. ", "Achish's officers asked, \"Isn't this David, the king of his country? He's the one they used to sing about in the dances: 'Saul has defeated thousands but David tens of thousands.'\" ", "When David realized what they had said, he was terrified of King Achish of Gath.

", "Then everyone who was in trouble, in debt, or bitter about life joined him, and he became their commander. There were about four hundred men with him. ", "From there David went to Mizpah in Moab. He asked the king of Moab, \"Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God is going to do for me.\" ", "He brought them to the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was living in his fortified camp.

No one felt sorry for me and informed me that my son has encouraged my servant David to ambush me, as he's doing now.\" ", "Then Doeg from Edom, standing with Saul's officials, answered him, \"I saw Jesse's son when he came to Ahimelech, Ahitub's son, in Nob.

Your Majesty, he's your son-in-law, the commander of your bodyguard. He's honored in your own household. ", "Is this the first time I have prayed to God for him? Not at all!

The time of beauty treatment was spent as follows: six months using oil of myrrh and six months using perfumes and other treatments for women. ", "After that, the young woman would go to the king. Anything she wanted to take with her from the women's quarters to the king's palace was given to her. ", "She would go in the evening and come back in the morning to the other quarters for women.

Decide how to treat us on the basis of how we look.\" ", "The supervisor listened to them about this matter and tested them for ten days.
