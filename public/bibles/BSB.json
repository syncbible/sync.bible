"books":{"Genesis":[["In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. \n   \n","Now the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. \n   \n","And God said, “Let there be light,”  and there was light. \n","And God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. \n","God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” \n  And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day. \n   \n","And God said, “Let there be an expanse  between the waters, to separate the waters from the waters.” \n","So God made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above. And it was so. \n","God called the expanse “sky.” \n  And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day. \n   \n","And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place, so that the dry land may appear.” And it was so. \n","God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of waters He called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. \n   \n","Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each bearing fruit with seed according to its kind.” And it was so. \n","The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. \n   \n","And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day. \n   \n","And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to distinguish between the day and the night, and let them be signs to mark the seasons and days and years. \n","And let them serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth.” And it was so. \n   \n","God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. And He made the stars as well. \n   \n","God set these lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth, \n","to preside over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. \n   \n","And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day. \n   \n","And God said, “Let the waters teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.” \n","So God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters teemed according to their kinds, and every bird of flight after its kind. And God saw that it was good. \n   \n","Then God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters of the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” \n   \n","And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day. \n   \n","And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, land crawlers, and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so. \n","God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that crawls upon the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. \n   \n","Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness, to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, and over all the earth itself  and every creature that crawls upon it.” \n   \n","So God created man in His own image; \n in the image of God He created him; \n male and female He created them. \n   \n","God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth.” \n   \n","Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit contains seed. They will be yours for food. \n","And to every beast of the earth and every bird of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. \n   \n","And God looked upon all that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. \n  And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day. \n"],["Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. \n","And by the seventh day God had finished the work He had been doing; so on that day He rested from all His work. \n   \n","Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on that day He rested from all the work of creation that He had accomplished. \n   \n","This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD  God made them. \n   \n","Now no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth, nor had any plant of the field sprouted; for the LORD God had not yet sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground. \n","But springs  welled up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. \n   \n","Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils, and the man became a living being. \n   \n","And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, where He placed the man He had formed. \n","Out of the ground the LORD God gave growth to every tree that is pleasing to the eye and good for food. And in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. \n   \n","Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it branched into four headwaters: \n   \n","The name of the first river is Pishon; it winds through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. \n","And the gold of that land is pure, and bdellium and onyx are found there. \n   \n","The name of the second river is Gihon; it winds through the whole land of Cush. \n   \n","The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it runs along the east side of Assyria. \n  And the fourth river is the Euphrates. \n   \n","Then the LORD God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it. \n   \n","And the LORD God commanded him, “You may eat freely from every tree of the garden, \n","but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.” \n   \n","The LORD God also said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make for him a suitable helper.” \n   \n","And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and He brought them to the man to see what he would name each one. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. \n","The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam  no suitable helper was found. \n   \n","So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, He took one of the man’s ribs  and closed up the area with flesh. \n","And from the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man, He made a woman and brought her to him. \n","And the man said: \n  “This is now bone of my bones \n and flesh of my flesh; \n she shall be called ‘woman,’ \n for out of man she was taken.” \n   \n","For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. \n   \n","And the man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed. \n"],["Now the serpent  was more crafty than any beast of the field that the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden?’” \n   \n","The woman answered the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden, \n","but about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You must not eat of it or touch it, or you will die.’” \n   \n","“You will not surely die,” the serpent told her. \n","“For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” \n   \n","When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom, she took the fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it. \n   \n","And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed together fig leaves and made coverings for themselves. \n   \n","Then the man and his wife heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the breeze  of the day, and they hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. \n   \n","But the LORD God called out to the man, “Where are you?” \n   \n","“I heard Your voice in the garden,” he replied, “and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.” \n   \n","“Who told you that you were naked?” asked the LORD God. “Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” \n   \n","And the man answered, “The woman whom You gave me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.” \n   \n","Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” \n  “The serpent deceived me,” she replied, “and I ate.” \n   \n","So the LORD God said to the serpent: \n  “Because you have done this, \n cursed are you above all livestock \n and every beast of the field! \n On your belly will you go, \n and dust you will eat, \n all the days of your life. \n  \n","And I will put enmity between you and the woman, \n and between your seed and her seed. \n He will crush your head, \n and you will strike his heel. ” \n   \n","To the woman He said: \n  “I will sharply increase your pain in childbirth; \n in pain you will bring forth children. \n Your desire will be for your husband, \n and he will rule over you.” \n   \n","And to Adam He said: \n  “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife \n and have eaten from the tree \n of which I commanded you not to eat, \n cursed is the ground because of you; \n through toil you will eat of it \n all the days of your life. \n  \n","Both thorns and thistles it will yield for you, \n and you will eat the plants of the field. \n  \n","By the sweat of your brow \n you will eat your bread, \n until you return to the ground—\n because out of it were you taken. \n For dust you are, \n and to dust you shall return.” \n   \n","And Adam named his wife Eve, because she would be the mother of all the living. \n   \n","And the LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them. \n   \n","Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil. And now, lest he reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...” \n   \n","Therefore the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. \n","So He drove out the man and stationed cherubim on the east side of the Garden of Eden, along with a whirling sword of flame to guard the way to the tree of life. \n"],["And Adam had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain. \n  “With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man,” she said. \n   \n","Later she gave birth to Cain’s brother Abel. \n  Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, while Cain was a tiller of the soil. \n","So in the course of time, Cain brought some of the fruit of the soil as an offering to the LORD, \n","while Abel brought the best portions of the firstborn of his flock. \n  And the LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, \n","but He had no regard for Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell. \n   \n","“Why are you angry,” said the LORD to Cain, “and why has your countenance fallen? \n","If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you refuse to do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires you, but you must master it.” \n   \n","Then Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out to the field.”  And while they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him. \n   \n","And the LORD said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” \n  “I do not know!” he answered. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” \n   \n","“What have you done?” replied the LORD. “The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground. \n","Now you are cursed and banished from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. \n","When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its produce to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.” \n   \n","But Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment  is greater than I can bear. \n","Behold, this day You have driven me from the face of the earth, and from Your face I will be hidden; I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” \n   \n","“Not so!” replied the LORD. “If anyone slays Cain, then Cain will be avenged sevenfold.” And the LORD placed a mark on Cain, so that no one who found him would kill him. \n   \n","So Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. \n   \n","And Cain had relations with his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Then Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch. \n   \n","Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methusael, and Methusael was the father of Lamech. \n","And Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. \n   \n","Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and raise livestock. \n","And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute. \n   \n","And Zillah gave birth to Tubal-cain, a forger of every implement of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. \n   \n","Then Lamech said to his wives: \n  “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; \n wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. \n For I have slain a man for wounding me, \n a young man for striking me. \n  \n","If Cain is avenged sevenfold, \n then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.” \n   \n","And Adam again had relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, “God has granted me another seed in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.” \n   \n","And to Seth also a son was born, and he called him Enosh. \n  At that time men began to call upon  the name of the LORD. \n"],["This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in His own likeness. \n","Male and female He created them,  and He blessed them. And in the day they were created, He called them “man.” \n   \n","When Adam was 130 years old, he had a son in his own likeness, after his own image; and he named him Seth. \n","And after he had become the father of Seth, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. \n","So Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died. \n   \n","When Seth was 105 years old, he became the father of Enosh. \n","And after he had become the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters. \n","So Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died. \n   \n","When Enosh was 90 years old, he became the father of Kenan. \n","And after he had become the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters. \n","So Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died. \n   \n","When Kenan was 70 years old, he became the father of Mahalalel. \n","And after he had become the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters. \n","So Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died. \n   \n","When Mahalalel was 65 years old, he became the father of Jared. \n","And after he had become the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters. \n","So Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died. \n   \n","When Jared was 162 years old, he became the father of Enoch. \n","And after he had become the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. \n","So Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died. \n   \n","When Enoch was 65 years old, he became the father of Methuselah. \n","And after he had become the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God  300 years and had other sons and daughters. \n","So Enoch lived a total of 365 years. \n   \n","Enoch walked with God, and then he was no more, because God had taken him away. \n   \n","When Methuselah was 187 years old, he became the father of Lamech. \n","And after he had become the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters. \n","So Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died. \n   \n","When Lamech was 182 years old, he had a son. \n","And he named him Noah, saying, “May this one comfort us in the labor and toil of our hands caused by the ground that the LORD has cursed.” \n","And after he had become the father of Noah, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters. \n","So Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died. \n   \n","After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. \n"],["Now when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born to them, \n","the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they took as wives whomever they chose. \n   \n","So the LORD said, “My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days shall be 120 years.” \n   \n","The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and afterward as well—when the sons of God had relations with the daughters of men. And they bore them children who became the mighty men of old, men of renown. \n   \n","Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was altogether evil all the time. \n","And the LORD regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. \n","So the LORD said, “I will blot out man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—every man and beast and crawling creature and bird of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them.” \n   \n","Noah, however, found favor in the eyes of the LORD. \n   \n","This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God. \n","And Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. \n   \n","Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and full of violence. \n","And God looked upon the earth and saw that it was corrupt; for all living creatures  on the earth had corrupted their ways. \n   \n","Then God said to Noah, “The end of all living creatures has come before Me, because through them the earth is full of violence. Now behold, I will destroy both them and the earth. \n   \n","Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; make rooms in the ark and coat it with pitch inside and out. \n","And this is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. \n","You are to make a roof   for the ark, finish its walls a cubit from the top, place a door in the side of the ark, and build lower, middle, and upper decks. \n   \n","And behold, I will bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy every creature under the heavens that has the breath of life. Everything on the earth will perish. \n","But I will establish My covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. \n   \n","And you are to bring two of every living creature into the ark—male and female—to keep them alive with you. \n","Two of every kind of bird and animal and crawling creature will come to you to be kept alive. \n","You are also to take for yourself every kind of food that is eaten and gather it as food for yourselves and for the animals.” \n   \n","So Noah did everything precisely as God had commanded him. \n"],["Then the LORD said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your family, because I have found you righteous in this generation. \n","You are to take with you seven pairs of  every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate; a pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate; \n","and seven pairs of every kind of bird of the air, male and female, to preserve their offspring on the face of all the earth. \n","For seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living thing I have made.” \n   \n","And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him. \n   \n","Now Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came upon the earth. \n","And Noah and his wife, with his sons and their wives, entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. \n","The clean and unclean animals, the birds, and everything that crawls along the ground \n","came to Noah to enter the ark, two by two, male and female, as God had commanded Noah. \n   \n","And after seven days the floodwaters came upon the earth. \n","In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month, all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened. \n","And the rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights. \n   \n","On that very day Noah entered the ark, along with his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and his wife, and the three wives of his sons—\n","they and every kind of wild animal, livestock, crawling creature, bird, and winged creature. \n","They came to Noah to enter the ark, two by two of every creature  with the breath of life. \n","And they entered, the male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in. \n   \n","For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and the waters rose and lifted the ark high above the earth. \n","So the waters continued to surge and rise greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the waters. \n","Finally, the waters completely inundated the earth, so that all the high mountains under all the heavens were covered. \n   \n","The waters rose and covered the mountaintops to a depth of fifteen cubits. \n","And every living thing that moved upon the earth perished—birds, livestock, animals, every creature that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind. \n","Of all that was on dry land, everything that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. \n","And every living thing on the face of the earth was destroyed—man and livestock, crawling creatures and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth, and only Noah and those with him in the ark remained. \n   \n","And the waters prevailed upon the earth for 150 days. \n"],["But God remembered Noah and all the animals and livestock that were with him in the ark. And God sent a wind over the earth, and the waters began to subside. \n","The springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained. \n","The waters receded steadily from the earth, and after 150 days the waters had gone down. \n   \n","On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. \n","And the waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible. \n   \n","After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark \n","and sent out a raven. It kept flying back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth. \n   \n","Then Noah sent out  a dove to see if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground. \n","But the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him in the ark, because the waters were still covering the surface of all the earth. So he reached out his hand and brought her back inside the ark. \n   \n","Noah waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. \n","And behold, the dove returned to him in the evening with a freshly plucked olive leaf in her beak. So Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth. \n   \n","And Noah waited seven more days and sent out the dove again, but this time she did not return to him. \n   \n","In Noah’s six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters had dried up from the earth. So Noah removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry. \n","By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was fully dry. \n   \n","Then God said to Noah, \n","“Come out of the ark, you and your wife, along with your sons and their wives. \n","Bring out all the living creatures that are with you—birds, livestock, and everything that crawls upon the ground—so that they can spread out over the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon it.” \n   \n","So Noah came out, along with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives. \n","Every living creature, every creeping thing, and every bird—everything that moves upon the earth—came out of the ark, kind by kind. \n   \n","Then Noah built an altar to the LORD. And taking from every kind of clean animal and clean bird, he offered burnt offerings on the altar. \n","When the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, He said in His heart, “Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from his youth. And never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done. \n   \n","As long as the earth endures, \n seedtime and harvest, \n cold and heat, \n summer and winter, \n day and night \n shall never cease.” \n"],["And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth. \n","The fear and dread of you will fall on every living creature on the earth, every bird of the air, every creature that crawls on the ground, and all the fish of the sea. They are delivered into your hand. \n","Everything that lives and moves will be food for you; just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you all things. \n","But you must not eat meat with its lifeblood still in it. \n","And surely I will require the life of any man or beast by whose hand your lifeblood is shed. I will demand an accounting from anyone who takes the life of his fellow man: \n   \n","Whoever sheds the blood of man, \n by man his blood will be shed; \n for in His own image \n God has made mankind. \n  \n","But as for you, \n be fruitful and multiply; \n spread out across the earth \n and multiply upon it.” \n   \n","Then God said to Noah and his sons with him, \n","“Behold, I now establish My covenant with you and your descendants after you, \n","and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth—every living thing that came out of the ark. \n","And I establish My covenant with you: Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.” \n   \n","And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between Me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: \n","I have set My rainbow in the clouds, and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. \n   \n","Whenever I form clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, \n","I will remember My covenant between Me and you and every living creature of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. \n","And whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of every kind that is on the earth.” \n   \n","So God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between Me and every creature on the earth.” \n   \n","The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham was the father of Canaan. \n","These three were the sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was populated. \n   \n","Now Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded  to plant a vineyard. \n","But when he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and uncovered himself inside his tent. \n","And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside. \n   \n","Then Shem and Japheth took a garment and placed it across their shoulders, and walking backward, they covered their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned away so that they did not see their father’s nakedness. \n   \n","When Noah awoke from his drunkenness and learned what his youngest son had done to him, \n","he said, \n  “Cursed be Canaan! \n A servant of servants \n shall he be to his brothers.” \n   \n","He also declared: \n  “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem! \n May Canaan be the servant of Shem. \n  \n","May God expand the territory of Japheth; \n may he dwell in the tents of Shem, \n and may Canaan be his servant.” \n   \n","After the flood, Noah lived 350 years. \n","So Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died. \n"],["This is the account of Noah’s sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who also had sons after the flood. \n   \n","The sons of Japheth: \n  Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. \n   \n","The sons of Gomer: \n  Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. \n   \n","And the sons of Javan: \n  Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites, and the Rodanites. \n","From these, the maritime peoples separated into their territories, according to their languages, by clans within their nations. \n   \n","The sons of Ham: \n  Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. \n   \n","The sons of Cush: \n  Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. \n  And the sons of Raamah: \n  Sheba and Dedan. \n   \n","Cush was the father of Nimrod, who began to be a mighty one  on the earth. \n","He was a mighty hunter before  the LORD; so it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.” \n","His kingdom began in Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. \n","From that land he went forth into Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, \n","and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city of Calah. \n   \n","Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites, \n","the Pathrusites, the Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came), and the Caphtorites. \n   \n","And Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites, \n","the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, \n","the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, \n","the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. \n  Later the Canaanite clans were scattered, \n","and the borders of Canaan extended from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. \n   \n","These are the sons of Ham according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations. \n   \n","And sons were also born to Shem, the older brother of Japheth; Shem was the forefather of all the sons of Eber. \n   \n","The sons of Shem: \n  Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. \n   \n","The sons of Aram: \n  Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. \n   \n","Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah was the father of Eber. \n   \n","Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and his brother was named Joktan. \n   \n","And Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, \n","Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, \n","Obal, Abimael, Sheba, \n","Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab.

Send them out to us so we can have relations with them!” \n   \n","Lot went outside to meet them, shutting the door behind him. \n","“Please, my brothers,” he pleaded, “don’t do such a wicked thing! \n","Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them to you, and you can do to them as you please. But do not do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.” \n   \n","“Get out of the way!” they replied. And they declared, “This one came here as a foreigner, and he is already acting like a judge! Now we will treat you worse than them.” And they pressed in on Lot and moved in to break down the door. \n   \n","But the men inside reached out, pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. \n","And they struck the men at the entrance, young and old, with blindness, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the door. \n   \n","Then the two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—a son-in-law, your sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, \n","because we are about to destroy this place. For the outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that He has sent us to destroy it.” \n   \n","So Lot went out and spoke to the sons-in-law who were pledged in marriage to his daughters. “Get up,” he said. “Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. \n   \n","At daybreak the angels hurried Lot along, saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.” \n","But when Lot hesitated, the men grabbed his hand and the hands of his wife and his two daughters. And they led them safely out of the city, because of the LORD’s compassion for them. \n   \n","As soon as the men had brought them out, one of them said, “Run for your lives! Do not look back, and do not stop anywhere on the plain! Flee to the mountains, or you will be swept away!” \n   \n","But Lot replied, “No, my lords, please! \n","Your servant has indeed found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness by sparing my life. But I cannot run to the mountains; the disaster will overtake me, and I will die. \n","Look, there is a town nearby where I can flee, and it is a small place. Please let me flee there—is it not a small place? Then my life will be saved.” \n   \n","“Very well,” he answered, “I will grant this request as well, and will not demolish the town you indicate. \n","Hurry! Run there quickly, for I cannot do anything until you reach it.” That is why the town was called Zoar. \n   \n","And by the time the sun had risen over the land, Lot had reached Zoar. \n   \n","Then the LORD rained down sulfur and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the heavens. \n","Thus He destroyed these cities and the entire plain, including all the inhabitants of the cities and everything that grew on the ground. \n   \n","But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. \n   \n","Early the next morning, Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD. \n","He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain, and he saw the smoke rising from the land like smoke from a furnace. \n   \n","So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, He remembered Abraham, and He brought Lot out of the catastrophe that destroyed the cities where he had lived. \n   \n","Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains—for he was afraid to stay in Zoar—where they lived in a cave. \n   \n","One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to sleep with us, as is the custom over all the earth. \n","Come, let us get our father drunk with wine so we can sleep with him and preserve his line.” \n   \n","So that night they got their father drunk with wine, and the firstborn went in and slept with her father; he was not aware when she lay down or when she got up. \n   \n","The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Look, I slept with my father last night. Let us get him drunk with wine again tonight so you can go in and sleep with him and we can preserve our father’s line.” \n   \n","So again that night they got their father drunk with wine, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him; he was not aware when she lay down or when she got up. \n   \n","Thus both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. \n","The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites of today. \n","The younger daughter also gave birth to a son, and she named him Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites of today. \n"],["Now Abraham journeyed from there to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was staying in Gerar, \n","Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar had Sarah brought to him. \n   \n","One night, however, God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman.” \n   \n","Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he replied, “Lord, would You destroy a nation even though it is innocent? \n","Didn’t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.” \n   \n","Then God said to Abimelech in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against Me. That is why I did not let you touch her. \n","Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet; he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, be aware that you will surely die—you and all who belong to you.” \n   \n","Early the next morning Abimelech got up and summoned all his servants; and when he described to them all that had happened, the men were terrified. \n   \n","Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such tremendous guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.” \n","Abimelech also asked Abraham, “What prompted you to do such a thing?” \n   \n","Abraham replied, “I thought to myself, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place. They will kill me on account of my wife.’ \n","Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father—though not the daughter of my mother—and she became my wife. \n","So when God had me journey from my father’s house, I said to Sarah, ‘This is how you can show your loyalty to me: Wherever we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’” \n   \n","So Abimelech brought sheep and cattle, menservants and maidservants, and he gave them to Abraham and restored his wife Sarah to him. \n","And Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you. Settle wherever you please.” \n","And he said to Sarah, “See, I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is your vindication before all who are with you; you are completely cleared.” \n   \n","Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, so that they could again bear children—\n","for on account of Abraham’s wife Sarah, the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech’s household. \n"],["Now the LORD attended to Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what He had promised. \n","So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised. \n   \n","And Abraham gave the name Isaac  to the son Sarah bore to him. \n","When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him. \n","Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. \n   \n","Then Sarah said, “God has made me laugh, and everyone who hears of this will laugh with me.” \n","She added, “Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.” \n   \n","So the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned. \n   \n","But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking her son, \n","and she said to Abraham, “Expel the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac!” \n   \n","Now this matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son Ishmael. \n","But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to everything that Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned. \n","But I will also make a nation of the slave woman’s son, because he is your offspring.” \n   \n","Early in the morning, Abraham got up, took bread and a skin of water, put them on Hagar’s shoulders, and sent her away with the boy. She left and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba. \n","When the water in the skin was gone, she left the boy under one of the bushes. \n","Then she went off and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she said, “I cannot bear to watch the boy die!” And as she sat nearby, she lifted up her voice and wept. \n   \n","Then God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, “What is wrong, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he lies. \n","Get up, lift up the boy, and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.” \n","Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. \n   \n","And God was with the boy, and he grew up and settled in the wilderness and became a great archer. \n","And while he was dwelling in the Wilderness of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt. \n   \n","At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do. \n","Now, therefore, swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or descendants. Show to me and to the country in which you reside the same kindness that I have shown to you.” \n   \n","And Abraham replied, “I swear it.” \n   \n","But when Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well that Abimelech’s servants had seized, \n","Abimelech replied, “I do not know who has done this. You did not tell me, so I have not heard about it until today.” \n   \n","So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. \n","Abraham separated seven ewe lambs from the flock, \n","and Abimelech asked him, “Why have you set apart these seven ewe lambs?” \n   \n","He replied, “You are to accept the seven ewe lambs from my hand as my witness that I dug this well.” \n","So that place was called Beersheba, because it was there that the two of them swore an oath. \n","After they had made the covenant at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army got up and returned to the land of the Philistines. \n   \n","And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal God. \n","And Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines for a long time. \n"],["Some time later God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” \n  “Here I am,” he answered. \n   \n","“Take your son,” God said, “your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will show you.” \n   \n","So Abraham got up early the next morning, saddled his donkey, and took along two of his servants and his son Isaac. He split the wood for a burnt offering and set out for the place God had designated. \n   \n","On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. \n","“Stay here with the donkey,” Abraham told his servants. “The boy and I will go over there to worship, and then we will return to you.” \n   \n","Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac. He himself carried the fire and the sacrificial knife, and the two of them walked on together. \n   \n","Then Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” \n  “Here I am, my son,” he replied. \n  “The fire and the wood are here,” said Isaac, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” \n   \n","Abraham answered, “God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two walked on together. \n   \n","When they arrived at the place God had designated, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood. He bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar, atop the wood. \n","Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. \n   \n","Just then the angel  of the LORD called out to him from heaven, “Abraham, Abraham!” \n  “Here I am,” he replied. \n   \n","“Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him,” said the angel, “for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your only son from me. ” \n   \n","Then Abraham looked up and saw behind him a ram  in a thicket, caught by its horns. So he went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. \n","And Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. So to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.” \n   \n","And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time, \n","saying, “By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your only son, \n","I will surely bless you, and I will multiply your descendants  like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will possess the gates of their enemies. \n","And through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.” \n   \n","Abraham went back to his servants, and they got up and set out together for Beersheba. And Abraham settled in Beersheba. \n   \n","Some time later, Abraham was told, “Milcah has also borne sons to your brother Nahor: \n","Uz the firstborn, his brother Buz, Kemuel (the father of Aram), \n","Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” \n   \n","And Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor. \n","Moreover, Nahor’s concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. \n"],["Now Sarah lived to be 127 years old. \n","She died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went out to mourn and to weep for her. \n   \n","Then Abraham got up from beside his dead wife and said to the Hittites, \n","“I am a foreigner and an outsider among you. Give me a burial site among you so that I can bury my dead.” \n   \n","The Hittites replied to Abraham, \n","“Listen to us, sir. You are God’s chosen one among us. Bury your dead in the finest of our tombs. None of us will withhold his tomb for burying your dead.” \n   \n","Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites. \n","“If you are willing for me to bury my dead,” he said to them, “listen to me, and approach Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf \n","to sell me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him; it is at the end of his field. Let him sell it to me in your presence for full price, so that I may have a burial site.” \n   \n","Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth. So in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city, Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham, \n","“No, my lord. Listen to me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.” \n   \n","Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land \n","and said to Ephron in their presence, “If you will please listen to me, I will pay you the price of the field. Accept it from me, so that I may bury my dead there.” \n   \n","Ephron answered Abraham, \n","“Listen to me, my lord. The land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.” \n   \n","Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the standard of the merchants. \n   \n","So Ephron’s field at Machpelah near Mamre, the cave that was in it, and all the trees within the boundaries of the field were deeded over \n","to Abraham’s possession in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city. \n","After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field at Machpelah near Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. \n","So the field and its cave were deeded by the Hittites to Abraham as a burial site. \n"],["By now Abraham was old and well along in years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way. \n","So Abraham instructed the chief servant of his household, who managed all he owned, “Place your hand under my thigh, \n","and I will have you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am dwelling, \n","but will go to my country and my kindred to take a wife for my son Isaac.” \n   \n","The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to follow me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the land from which you came?” \n   \n","Abraham replied, “Make sure that you do not take my son back there. \n","The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me from my father’s house and my native land, who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, ‘To your offspring I will give this land’—He will send His angel before you so that you can take a wife for my son from there. \n","And if the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you are released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.” \n   \n","So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter. \n   \n","Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed with all manner of good things from his master in hand. And he set out for Nahor’s hometown in Aram-naharaim. \n","As evening approached, he made the camels kneel down near the well outside the town at the time when the women went out to draw water. \n   \n","“O LORD, God of my master Abraham,” he prayed, “please grant me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. \n","Here I am, standing beside the spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. \n","Now may it happen that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar that I may drink,’ and who responds, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well’—let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. By this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.” \n   \n","Before the servant had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor. \n","Now the girl was very beautiful, a virgin who had not had relations with any man. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up again. \n   \n","So the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me have a little water from your jar.” \n   \n","“Drink, my lord,” she replied, and she quickly lowered her jar to her hands and gave him a drink. \n   \n","After she had given him a drink, she said, “I will also draw water for your camels, until they have had enough to drink.” \n","And she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran back to the well to draw water, until she had drawn water for all his camels. \n   \n","Meanwhile, the man watched her silently to see whether or not the LORD had made his journey a success. \n   \n","And after the camels had finished drinking, he took out a gold ring weighing a beka,  and two gold bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels. \n","“Whose daughter are you?” he asked. “Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?” \n   \n","She replied, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor.” \n","Then she added, “We have plenty of straw and feed, as well as a place for you to spend the night.” \n   \n","Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD, \n","saying, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld His kindness and faithfulness from my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.” \n   \n","The girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things. \n","Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he rushed out to the man at the spring. \n","As soon as he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and heard Rebekah’s words, “The man said this to me,” he went and found the man standing by the camels near the spring. \n   \n","“Come, you who are blessed by the LORD,” said Laban. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.” \n","So the man came to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and feed were brought to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of his companions. \n   \n","Then a meal was set before the man, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I came to say.” \n  So Laban said, “Please speak.” \n   \n","“I am Abraham’s servant,” he replied. \n","“The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become rich. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, camels and donkeys. \n","My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and my master has given him everything he owns. \n   \n","My master made me swear an oath and said, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell, \n","but you shall go to my father’s house and to my kindred to take a wife for my son.’ \n   \n","Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’ \n   \n","And he told me, ‘The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you may take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father’s house. \n","And when you go to my kindred, if they refuse to give her to you, then you will be released from my oath.’ \n   \n","So when I came to the spring today, I prayed: O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if only You would make my journey a success! \n","Here I am, standing beside this spring. Now if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, ‘Please let me drink a little water from your jar,’ \n","and she replies, ‘Drink, and I will draw water for your camels as well,’ may she be the woman the LORD has appointed for my master’s son. \n   \n","And before I had finished praying in my heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’ \n   \n","She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels. \n   \n","Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ \n  She replied, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists. \n","Then I bowed down and worshiped the LORD; and I blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who led me on the right road to take the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son. \n   \n","Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; but if not, let me know, so that I may go elsewhere.” \n   \n","Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the LORD; we have no choice in the matter. \n","Rebekah is here before you. Take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, just as the LORD has decreed.” \n   \n","When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD. \n","Then he brought out jewels of silver and gold, and articles of clothing, and he gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brother and her mother. \n","Then he and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night there. \n  When they got up the next morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.” \n   \n","But her brother and mother said, “Let the girl remain with us ten days or so. After that, she may go.” \n   \n","But he replied, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has made my journey a success. Send me on my way so that I may go to my master.” \n   \n","So they said, “We will call the girl and ask her opinion.” \n   \n","They called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?” \n  “I will go,” she replied. \n   \n","So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men. \n","And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, \n  “Our sister, may you become the mother \n of thousands upon thousands. \n May your offspring possess \n the gates of their enemies.” \n   \n","Then Rebekah and her servant girls got ready, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left. \n   \n","Now Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi, for he was living in the Negev. \n","Early in the evening, Isaac went out to the field to meditate, and looking up, he saw the camels approaching. \n   \n","And when Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac, she got down from her camel \n","and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?” \n  “It is my master,” the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself. \n","Then the servant told Isaac all that he had done. \n   \n","And Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah and took Rebekah as his wife. And Isaac loved her and was comforted after his mother’s death. \n"],["Now Abraham had taken another wife, named Keturah, \n","and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. \n   \n","Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites. \n   \n","The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. \n  All these were descendants of Keturah. \n   \n","Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac. \n","But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east. \n   \n","Abraham lived a total of 175 years. \n","And at a ripe old age he breathed his last and died, old and contented, and was gathered to his people. \n   \n","His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite. \n","This was the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites. Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah. \n   \n","After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi. \n   \n","This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham. \n","These are the names of the sons of Ishmael in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, \n","Mishma, Dumah, Massa, \n","Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. \n   \n","These were the sons of Ishmael, and these were their names by their villages and encampments—twelve princes of their tribes. \n","Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people. \n   \n","Ishmael’s descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which is near the border of Egypt as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers. \n   \n","This is the account of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac, \n","and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram  and the sister of Laban the Aramean. \n   \n","Later, Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD heard his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived. \n   \n","But the children inside her struggled with each other, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So Rebekah went to inquire of the LORD, \n","and He declared to her: \n  “Two nations are in your womb, \n and two peoples from within you will be separated; \n one people will be stronger than the other, \n and the older will serve the younger.” \n   \n","When her time came to give birth, there were indeed twins in her womb. \n","The first one came out red, covered with hair like a fur coat; so they named him Esau. \n","After this, his brother came out grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born. \n   \n","When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home. \n","Because Isaac had a taste for wild game, he loved Esau; but Rebekah loved Jacob. \n   \n","One day, while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the field and was famished. \n","He said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am famished.” (That is why he was also called Edom. ) \n   \n","“First sell me your birthright,” Jacob replied. \n   \n","“Look,” said Esau, “I am about to die, so what good is a birthright to me?” \n   \n","“Swear to me first,” Jacob said. \n  So Esau swore to Jacob and sold him the birthright. \n","Then Jacob gave some bread and lentil stew to Esau, who ate and drank and then got up and went away. Thus Esau despised his birthright. \n"],["Now there was another famine in the land, subsequent to the one that had occurred in Abraham’s time. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar. \n   \n","The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt. Settle in the land where I tell you. \n","Stay in this land as a foreigner, and I will be with you and bless you. For I will give all these lands to you and your offspring, and I will confirm the oath that I swore to your father Abraham. \n","I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give them all these lands, and through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed, \n","because Abraham listened to My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.” \n   \n","So Isaac settled in Gerar. \n","But when the men of that place asked about his wife, he said, “She is my sister.” For he was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” since he thought to himself, “The men of this place will kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is so beautiful.” \n   \n","When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from the window and was surprised to see Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. \n","Abimelech sent for Isaac and said, “So she is really your wife! How could you say, ‘She is my sister’?” \n  Isaac replied, “Because I thought I might die on account of her.” \n   \n","“What is this you have done to us?” asked Abimelech. “One of the people could easily have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.” \n","So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, “Whoever harms this man or his wife will surely be put to death.” \n   \n","Now Isaac sowed seed in the land, and that very year he reaped a hundredfold. And the LORD blessed him, \n","and he became richer and richer, until he was exceedingly wealthy. \n","He owned so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him. \n","So the Philistines took dirt and stopped up all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham. \n   \n","Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Depart from us, for you are much too powerful for us.” \n   \n","So Isaac left that place and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there. \n","Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died. And he gave these wells the same names his father had given them. \n   \n","Then Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found a well of fresh water  there. \n","But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek, because they contended with him. \n   \n","Then they dug another well and quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah. \n   \n","He moved on from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. He named it Rehoboth  and said, “At last the LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.” \n   \n","From there Isaac went up to Beersheba, \n","and that night the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of My servant Abraham.” \n   \n","So Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD, and he pitched his tent there. His servants also dug a well there. \n   \n","Later, Abimelech came to Isaac from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army. \n   \n","“Why have you come to me?” Isaac asked them. “You hated me and sent me away.” \n   \n","“We can plainly see that the LORD has been with you,” they replied. “We recommend that there should now be an oath between us and you. Let us make a covenant with you \n","that you will not harm us, just as we have not harmed you but have done only good to you, sending you on your way in peace. And now you are blessed by the LORD.” \n   \n","So Isaac prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank. \n","And they got up early the next morning and swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace. \n   \n","On that same day, Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. “We have found water!” they told him. \n","So he called it Shibah,  and to this day the name of the city is Beersheba. \n   \n","When Esau was forty years old, he took as his wives Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite. \n","And they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah. \n"],["When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.” \n  “Here I am,” Esau replied. \n   \n","“Look,” said Isaac, “I am now old, and I do not know the day of my death. \n","Take your weapons—your quiver and bow—and go out into the field to hunt some game for me. \n","Then prepare a tasty dish that I love and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die.” \n   \n","Now Rebekah was listening to what Isaac told his son Esau. So when Esau went into the field to hunt game and bring it back, \n","Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Behold, I overheard your father saying to your brother Esau, \n","‘Bring me some game and prepare me a tasty dish to eat, so that I may bless you in the presence of the LORD before I die.’ \n   \n","Now, my son, listen to my voice and do exactly as I tell you. \n","Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so that I can make them into a tasty dish for your father—the kind he loves. \n","Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.” \n   \n","Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, “Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I am smooth-skinned. \n","What if my father touches me? Then I would be revealed to him as a deceiver, and I would bring upon myself a curse rather than a blessing.” \n   \n","His mother replied, “Your curse be on me, my son. Just obey my voice and go get them for me.” \n   \n","So Jacob went and got two goats and brought them to his mother, who made the tasty food his father loved. \n","And Rebekah took the finest clothes in the house that belonged to her older son Esau, and she put them on her younger son Jacob. \n","She also put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. \n","Then she handed her son Jacob the tasty food and bread she had made. \n   \n","So Jacob went to his father and said, “My father.” \n  “Here I am!” he answered. “Which one are you, my son?” \n   \n","Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me.” \n   \n","But Isaac asked his son, “How did you ever find it so quickly, my son?” \n  “Because the LORD your God brought it to me,” he replied. \n   \n","Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come closer so I can touch you, my son. Are you really my son Esau, or not?” \n   \n","So Jacob came close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” \n","Isaac did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him. \n   \n","Again he asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” \n  And he replied, “I am.” \n   \n","“Serve me,” said Isaac, “and let me eat some of my son’s game, so that I may bless you.” \n  Jacob brought it to him, and he ate; then he brought him wine, and he drank. \n   \n","Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come near and kiss me, my son.” \n   \n","So he came near and kissed him. When Isaac smelled his clothing, he blessed him and said: \n  “Ah, the smell of my son \n is like the smell of a field \n that the LORD has blessed. \n  \n","May God give to you the dew of heaven \n and the richness of the earth—\n an abundance of grain and new wine. \n  \n","May peoples serve you \n and nations bow down to you. \n May you be the master of your brothers, \n and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. \n May those who curse you be cursed, \n and those who bless you be blessed.” \n   \n","As soon as Isaac had finished blessing him and Jacob had left his father’s presence, his brother Esau returned from the hunt. \n","He too made some tasty food, brought it to his father, and said to him, “My father, sit up and eat of your son’s game, so that you may bless me.” \n   \n","But his father Isaac replied, “Who are you?” \n  “I am Esau, your firstborn son,” he answered. \n   \n","Isaac began to tremble violently and said, “Who was it, then, who hunted the game and brought it to me? Before you came in, I ate it all and blessed him—and indeed, he will be blessed!” \n   \n","When Esau heard his father’s words, he let out a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me too, O my father!” \n   \n","But Isaac replied, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.” \n   \n","So Esau declared, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me twice. He took my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing.” Then he asked, “Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?” \n   \n","But Isaac answered Esau: “Look, I have made him your master and given him all his relatives as servants; I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What is left that I can do for you, my son?” \n   \n","Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, O my father!” Then Esau wept aloud. \n   \n","His father Isaac answered him: \n  “Behold, your dwelling place shall be \n away from the richness of the land, \n away from the dew of heaven above. \n  \n","You shall live by the sword \n and serve your brother. \n But when you rebel, \n you will tear his yoke from your neck.” \n   \n","Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. And Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” \n   \n","When the words of her older son Esau were relayed to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and told him, “Look, your brother Esau is consoling himself by plotting to kill you. \n","So now, my son, obey my voice and flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran. \n","Stay with him for a while, until your brother’s fury subsides—\n","until your brother’s rage against you wanes and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send for you and bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?” \n   \n","Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a Hittite wife from among them, what good is my life?” \n"],["So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. “Do not take a wife from the Canaanite women,” he commanded. \n","“Go at once to Paddan-aram, to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel, and take a wife from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. \n","May God Almighty  bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, so that you may become a company of peoples. \n","And may He give the blessing of Abraham to you and your descendants, so that you may possess the land where you dwell as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.” \n   \n","So Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau. \n   \n","Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to take a wife there, commanding him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,” \n","and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and gone to Paddan-aram. \n   \n","And seeing that his father Isaac disapproved of the Canaanite women, \n","Esau went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael, in addition to the wives he already had. \n   \n","Meanwhile Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran. \n","On reaching a certain place, he spent the night there because the sun had set. And taking one of the stones from that place, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep. \n   \n","And Jacob had a dream about a ladder that rested on the earth with its top reaching up to heaven, and God’s angels were going up and down the ladder. \n","And there at the top  the LORD was standing and saying, “I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you now lie. \n","Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and east and north and south. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your offspring. \n","Look, I am with you, and I will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” \n   \n","When Jacob woke up, he thought, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was unaware of it.” \n","And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven!” \n   \n","Early the next morning, Jacob took the stone that he had placed under his head, and he set it up as a pillar. He poured oil on top of it, \n","and he called that place Bethel, though previously the city had been named Luz. \n   \n","Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and watch over me on this journey, and if He will provide me with food to eat and clothes to wear, \n","so that I may return safely to my father’s house, then the LORD will be my God. \n","And this stone I have set up as a pillar will be God’s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give You a tenth.” \n"],["Jacob resumed his journey and came to the land of the people of the east. \n","He looked and saw a well in the field, and near it lay three flocks of sheep, because the sheep were watered from this well. And a large stone covered the mouth of the well. \n","When all the flocks had been gathered there, the shepherds would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well. \n   \n","“My brothers,” Jacob asked the shepherds, “where are you from?” \n  “We are from Haran,” they answered. \n   \n","“Do you know Laban the grandson of Nahor?” Jacob asked. \n  “We know him,” they replied. \n   \n","“Is he well?” Jacob inquired. \n  “Yes,” they answered, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with his sheep.” \n   \n","“Look,” said Jacob, “it is still broad daylight; it is not yet time to gather the livestock. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.” \n   \n","But they replied, “We cannot, until all the flocks have been gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.” \n   \n","While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. \n","As soon as Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his mother’s brother Laban, with Laban’s sheep, he went up and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep. \n","Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. \n","He told Rachel that he was Rebekah’s son, a relative of her father, and she ran and told her father. \n   \n","When Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran out to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, where Jacob told him all that had happened. \n   \n","Then Laban declared, “You are indeed my own flesh and blood.” \n  After Jacob had stayed with him a month, \n","Laban said to him, “Just because you are my relative, should you work for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.” \n   \n","Now Laban had two daughters; the older was named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel. \n","Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was shapely and beautiful. \n","Since Jacob loved Rachel, he answered, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.” \n   \n","Laban replied, “Better that I give her to you than to another. Stay here with me.” \n","So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, yet it seemed but a few days because of his love for her. \n   \n","Finally Jacob said to Laban, “Grant me my wife, for my time is complete, and I want to sleep with her.” \n   \n","So Laban invited all the men of that place and prepared a feast. \n","But when evening came, Laban took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and he slept with her. \n","And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maidservant. \n   \n","When morning came, there was Leah! “What have you done to me?” Jacob said to Laban. “Wasn’t it for Rachel that I served you? Why have you deceived me?” \n   \n","Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older. \n","Finish this week’s celebration, and we will give you the younger one in return for another seven years of work.” \n   \n","And Jacob did just that. He finished the week’s celebration, and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife. \n","Laban also gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant. \n   \n","Jacob slept with Rachel as well, and indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah. So he worked for Laban another seven years. \n   \n","When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren. \n","And Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she named him Reuben, for she said, “The LORD has seen my affliction. Surely my husband will love me now.” \n   \n","Again she conceived and gave birth to a son, and she said, “Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has given me this son as well.” So she named him Simeon. \n   \n","Once again Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi. \n   \n","And once more she conceived and gave birth to a son and said, “This time I will praise the LORD.” So she named him Judah. Then Leah stopped having children. \n"],["When Rachel saw that she was not bearing any children for Jacob, she envied her sister. “Give me children, or I will die!” she said to Jacob. \n   \n","Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld children from you?” \n   \n","Then she said, “Here is my maidservant Bilhah. Sleep with her, that she may bear children for me, so that through her I too can build a family.” \n   \n","So Rachel gave Jacob her servant Bilhah as a wife, and he slept with her, \n","and Bilhah conceived and bore him a son. \n","Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; He has heard my plea and given me a son.” So she named him Dan. \n   \n","And Rachel’s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. \n","Then Rachel said, “In my great struggles, I have wrestled with my sister and won.” So she named him Naphtali. \n   \n","When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife. \n","And Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son. \n","Then Leah said, “How fortunate!”  So she named him Gad. \n   \n","When Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son, \n","Leah said, “How happy I am! For the women call me happy.” So she named him Asher. \n   \n","Now during the wheat harvest, Reuben went out and found some mandrakes in the field. When he brought them to his mother, Rachel begged Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” \n   \n","But Leah replied, “Is it not enough that you have taken away my husband? Now you want to take my son’s mandrakes as well?” \n  “Very well,” said Rachel, “he may sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.” \n   \n","When Jacob came in from the field that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come with me, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night. \n   \n","And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore a fifth son to Jacob. \n","Then Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar. \n   \n","Again Leah conceived and bore a sixth son to Jacob. \n","“God has given me a good gift,” she said. “This time my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons.” And she named him Zebulun. \n   \n","After that, Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah. \n   \n","Then God remembered Rachel. He listened to her and opened her womb, \n","and she conceived and gave birth to a son. “God has taken away my shame,” she said. \n","She named him Joseph, and said, “May the LORD add to me another son.” \n   \n","Now after Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so I can return to my homeland. \n","Give me my wives and children for whom I have served you, that I may go on my way. You know how hard I have worked for you.” \n   \n","But Laban replied, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.” \n","And he added, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.” \n   \n","Then Jacob answered, “You know how I have served you and how your livestock have thrived under my care. \n","Indeed, you had very little before my arrival, but now your wealth has increased many times over. The LORD has blessed you wherever I set foot. But now, when may I also provide for my own household?” \n   \n","“What can I give you?” Laban asked. \n  “You do not need to give me anything,” Jacob replied. “If you do this one thing for me, I will keep on shepherding and keeping your flocks. \n","Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb, and every spotted or speckled goat. These will be my wages. \n","So my honesty will testify for me when you come to check on my wages in the future. If I have any goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any lambs that are not dark-colored, they will be considered stolen.” \n   \n","“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.” \n   \n","That very day Laban removed all the streaked or spotted male goats and every speckled or spotted female goat—every one that had any white on it—and every dark-colored lamb, and he placed them under the care of his sons. \n","Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob was shepherding the rest of Laban’s flocks. \n   \n","Jacob, however, took fresh branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees, and peeled the bark, exposing the white inner wood of the branches. \n","Then he set the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of the flocks coming in to drink. So when the flocks were in heat and came to drink, \n","they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted. \n","Jacob set apart the young, but made the rest face the streaked dark-colored sheep in Laban’s flocks. Then he set his own stock apart and did not put them with Laban’s animals. \n   \n","Whenever the stronger females of the flock were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs, in full view of the animals, so that they would breed in front of the branches. \n","But if the animals were weak, he did not set out the branches. So the weaker animals went to Laban and the stronger ones to Jacob. \n   \n","Thus Jacob became exceedingly prosperous. He owned large flocks, maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys. \n"],["Now Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken away all that belonged to our father and built all this wealth at our father’s expense.” \n","And Jacob saw from the countenance of Laban that his attitude toward him had changed. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.” \n   \n","So Jacob sent word and called Rachel and Leah to the field where his flocks were, \n","and he told them, “I can see from your father’s countenance that his attitude toward me has changed; but the God of my father has been with me. \n","You know that I have served your father with all my strength. \n","And although he has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, God has not allowed him to harm me. \n","If he said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then the whole flock bore speckled offspring. If he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then the whole flock bore streaked offspring. \n","Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock and given them to me. \n   \n","When the flocks were breeding, I saw in a dream that the streaked, spotted, and speckled males were mating with the females. \n","In that dream the angel  of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ \n  And I replied, ‘Here I am.’ \n   \n","‘Look up,’ he said, ‘and see that all the males that are mating with the flock are streaked, spotted, or speckled; for I have seen all that Laban has done to you. \n","I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and made a solemn vow to Me. Now get up and leave this land at once, and return to your native land.’” \n   \n","And Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we have any portion or inheritance left in our father’s house? \n","Are we not regarded by him as outsiders? Not only has he sold us, but he has certainly squandered what was paid for us. \n","Surely all the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So do whatever God has told you.” \n   \n","Then Jacob got up and put his children and his wives on camels, \n","and he drove all his livestock before him, along with all the possessions he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land in Canaan. \n   \n","Now while Laban was out shearing his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household idols. \n","Moreover, Jacob deceived  Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was running away. \n","So he fled with all his possessions, crossed the Euphrates, and headed for the hill country of Gilead. \n   \n","On the third day Laban was informed that Jacob had fled. \n","So he took his relatives with him, pursued Jacob for seven days, and overtook him in the hill country of Gilead. \n","But that night God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream and warned him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.” \n   \n","Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there as well. \n","Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You have deceived me and carried off my daughters like captives of war! \n","Why did you run away secretly and deceive me, without even telling me? I would have sent you away with joy and singing, with tambourines and harps. \n","But you did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. Now you have done a foolish thing. \n   \n","I have power to do you great harm, but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’ \n","Now you have gone off because you long for your father’s house. But why have you stolen my gods?” \n   \n","“I was afraid,” Jacob answered, “for I thought you would take your daughters from me by force. \n","If you find your gods with anyone here, he shall not live! In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself if anything is yours, and take it back.” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the idols. \n   \n","So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, then Leah’s tent, and then the tents of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. Then he left Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent. \n","Now Rachel had taken Laban’s household idols, put them in the saddlebag of her camel, and was sitting on them. And Laban searched everything in the tent but found nothing. \n   \n","Rachel said to her father, “Sir, do not be angry that I cannot stand up before you; for I am having my period.” So Laban searched, but could not find the household idols. \n   \n","Then Jacob became incensed and challenged Laban. “What is my crime?” he said. “For what sin of mine have you so hotly pursued me? \n","You have searched all my goods! Have you found anything that belongs to you? Put it here before my brothers and yours, that they may judge between the two of us. \n   \n","I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flock. \n","I did not bring you anything torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for what was stolen by day or night. \n","As it was, the heat consumed me by day and the frost by night, and sleep fled from my eyes. \n   \n","Thus for twenty years I have served in your household—fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks—and you have changed my wages ten times! \n","If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, surely by now you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and last night He rendered judgment.” \n   \n","But Laban answered Jacob, “These daughters are my daughters, these sons are my sons, and these flocks are my flocks! Everything you see is mine! Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine or the children they have borne? \n","Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between you and me.” \n   \n","So Jacob picked out a stone and set it up as a pillar, \n","and he said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and made a mound, and there by the mound they ate. \n","Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed. \n   \n","Then Laban declared, “This mound is a witness between you and me this day.” \n  Therefore the place was called Galeed. \n","It was also called Mizpah, because Laban said, “May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are absent from each other. \n","If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives, although no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.” \n   \n","Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is the mound, and here is the pillar I have set up between you and me. \n","This mound is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this mound to harm you, and you will not go past this mound and pillar to harm me. \n","May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” \n  So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. \n   \n","Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat a meal. And after they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain. \n","Early the next morning, Laban got up and kissed his grandchildren and daughters and blessed them. Then he left to return home. \n"],["Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him. \n","When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God.” So he named that place Mahanaim. \n   \n","Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. \n","He instructed them, “You are to say to my master Esau, ‘Your servant Jacob says: I have been staying with Laban and have remained there until now. \n","I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, menservants, and maidservants. I have sent this message to inform my master, so that I may find favor in your sight.’” \n   \n","When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you—he and four hundred men with him.” \n   \n","In great fear and distress, Jacob divided his people into two camps, as well as the flocks and herds and camels. \n","He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one camp, then the other camp can escape.” \n   \n","Then Jacob declared, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, the LORD who told me, ‘Go back to your country and to your kindred, and I will make you prosper,’ \n","I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan, but now I have become two camps. \n","Please deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid that he may come and attack me and the mothers and children with me. \n","But You have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea, too numerous to count.’” \n   \n","Jacob spent the night there, and from what he had brought with him, he selected a gift for his brother Esau: \n","200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, \n","30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys. \n","He entrusted them to his servants in separate herds and told them, “Go on ahead of me, and keep some distance between the herds.” \n   \n","He instructed the one in the lead, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, where are you going, and whose animals are these before you?’ \n","then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift, sent to my lord Esau. And behold, Jacob is behind us.’” \n   \n","He also instructed the second, the third, and all those following behind the herds: “When you meet Esau, you are to say the same thing to him. \n","You are also to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’” For he thought, “I will appease Esau   with the gift that is going before me. After that I can face him, and perhaps he will accept me. ” \n   \n","So Jacob’s gifts went on before him, while he spent the night in the camp. \n   \n","During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. \n","He took them and sent them across the stream, along with all his possessions. \n   \n","So Jacob was left all alone, and there a man  wrestled with him until daybreak. \n","When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip and dislocated it as they wrestled. \n","Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” \n  But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.” \n   \n","“What is your name?” the man asked. \n  “Jacob,” he replied. \n   \n","Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob,  but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men, and you have prevailed.” \n   \n","And Jacob requested, “Please tell me your name.” \n  But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed Jacob there. \n   \n","So Jacob named the place Peniel, saying, “Indeed, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared.” \n   \n","The sun rose above him as he passed by Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip. \n","Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon which is at the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was struck near that tendon. \n"],["Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming toward him with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants. \n","He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. \n","But Jacob himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. \n   \n","Esau, however, ran to him and embraced him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. And they both wept. \n   \n","When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, “Who are these with you?” \n  Jacob answered, “These are the children God has graciously given your servant.” \n","Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down. \n","Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down. \n   \n","“What do you mean by sending this whole company to meet me?” asked Esau. \n  “To find favor in your sight, my lord,” Jacob answered. \n   \n","“I already have plenty, my brother,” Esau replied. “Keep what belongs to you.” \n   \n","But Jacob insisted, “No, please! If I have found favor in your sight, then receive this gift from my hand. For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God, since you have received me favorably. \n","Please accept my gift  that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” So Jacob pressed him until he accepted. \n   \n","Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way, and I will go ahead of you.” \n   \n","But Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and I must care for sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard for even a day, all the animals will die. \n","Please let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will continue on slowly, at a comfortable pace for the livestock and children, until I come to my lord at Seir.” \n   \n","“Let me leave some of my people with you,” Esau said. \n  But Jacob replied, “Why do that? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.” \n   \n","So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir, \n","but Jacob went on to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and shelters for his livestock; that is why the place was called Succoth. \n   \n","After Jacob had come from Paddan-aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he camped just outside the city. \n","And the plot of ground where he pitched his tent, he purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver. \n","There he set up an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel. \n"],["Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land. \n","When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw her, he took her and lay with her by force. \n","And his soul was drawn to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young girl and spoke to her tenderly. \n","So Shechem told his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as a wife.” \n   \n","Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah, but since his sons were with his livestock in the field, he remained silent about it until they returned. \n","Meanwhile, Shechem’s father Hamor came to speak with Jacob. \n","When Jacob’s sons heard what had happened, they returned from the field. They were filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had committed an outrage in Israel  by lying with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not be done. \n   \n","But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife. \n","Intermarry with us; give us your daughters, and take our daughters for yourselves. \n","You may settle among us, and the land will be open to you. Live here, move about freely, and acquire your own property.” \n   \n","Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Grant me this favor, and I will give you whatever you ask. \n","Demand a high dowry and an expensive gift, and I will give you whatever you ask. Only give me the girl as my wife!” \n   \n","But because Shechem had defiled their sister Dinah, Jacob’s sons answered him and his father Hamor deceitfully. \n","“We cannot do such a thing,” they said. “To give our sister to an uncircumcised man would be a disgrace to us. \n","We will consent to this on one condition, that you become circumcised like us—every one of your males. \n","Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We will dwell among you and become one people. \n","But if you will not agree to be circumcised, then we will take our sister and go.” \n   \n","Their offer seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem. \n","The young man, who was the most respected of all his father’s household, did not hesitate to fulfill this request, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. \n   \n","So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and addressed the men of their city: \n","“These men are at peace with us. Let them live and trade in our land; indeed, it is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage and give our daughters to them. \n","But only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us and be one people: if all our men are circumcised as they are. \n","Will not their livestock, their possessions, and all their animals become ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell among us.” \n   \n","All the men who went out of the city gate listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male of the city was circumcised. \n   \n","Three days later, while they were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons (Dinah’s brothers Simeon and Levi) took their swords, went into the unsuspecting city, and slaughtered every male. \n","They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords, took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away. \n   \n","Jacob’s other sons came upon the slaughter and looted the city, because their sister had been defiled. \n","They took their flocks and herds and donkeys, and everything else in the city or in the field. \n","They carried off all their possessions and women and children, and they plundered everything in their houses. \n   \n","Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble upon me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people of this land. We are few in number; if they unite against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.” \n   \n","But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?” \n"],["Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and settle there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.” \n   \n","So Jacob told his household and all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Purify yourselves and change your garments. \n","Then let us arise and go to Bethel. I will build an altar there to God, who answered me in my day of distress. He has been with me wherever I have gone.” \n   \n","So they gave Jacob all their foreign gods and all their earrings, and Jacob buried them under the oak  near Shechem. \n   \n","As they set out, a terror from God fell over the surrounding cities, so that they did not pursue Jacob’s sons. \n","So Jacob and everyone with him arrived in Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. \n","There Jacob built an altar, and he called that place El-bethel, because it was there that God had revealed Himself to Jacob as he fled from his brother. \n   \n","Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak   below Bethel. So Jacob named it Allon-bachuth. \n   \n","After Jacob had returned from Paddan-aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him. \n","And God said to him, “Though your name is Jacob,  you will no longer be called Jacob. Instead, your name will be Israel. ” So God named him Israel. \n   \n","And God told him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation—even a company of nations—shall come from you, and kings shall descend from you. \n","The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.” \n   \n","Then God went up from the place where He had spoken with him. \n   \n","So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God had spoken with him—a stone marker—and he poured out a drink offering on it and anointed it with oil. \n","Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel. \n   \n","Later, they set out from Bethel, and while they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was difficult. \n","During her severe labor, the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you are having another son.” \n   \n","And with her last breath—for she was dying—she named him Ben-oni.  But his father called him Benjamin. \n   \n","So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). \n","Jacob set up a pillar on her grave; it marks Rachel’s tomb to this day. \n   \n","Israel again set out and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder. \n","While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it. \n  Jacob had twelve sons: \n   \n","The sons of Leah were Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. \n   \n","The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin. \n   \n","The sons of Rachel’s maidservant Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali. \n   \n","And the sons of Leah’s maidservant Zilpah were Gad and Asher. \n  These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram. \n   \n","Jacob returned to his father Isaac at Mamre, near Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. \n   \n","And Isaac lived 180 years. \n","Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years.

Will your mother and brothers and I actually come and bow down to the ground before you?” \n","And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept in mind what he had said. \n   \n","Some time later, Joseph’s brothers had gone to pasture their father’s flocks near Shechem. \n","Israel said to him, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flocks at Shechem? Get ready; I am sending you to them.” \n  “I am ready,” Joseph replied. \n   \n","Then Israel told him, “Go now and see how your brothers and the flocks are faring, and bring word back to me.” \n  So he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron.

And she removed her veil and put on her widow’s garments again. \n   \n","Now when Judah sent his friend Hirah the Adullamite with the young goat to collect the items he had left with the woman, he could not find her. \n","He asked the men of that place, “Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?” \n  “No shrine prostitute has been here,” they answered. \n   \n","So Hirah returned to Judah and said, “I could not find her, and furthermore, the men of that place said, ‘No shrine prostitute has been here.’” \n   \n","“Let her keep the items,” Judah replied. “Otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you could not find her.” \n   \n","About three months later, Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has prostituted herself, and now she is pregnant.” \n  “Bring her out!” Judah replied. “Let her be burned to death!” \n   \n","As she was being brought out, Tamar sent a message to her father-in-law: “I am pregnant by the man to whom these items belong.” And she added, “Please examine them. Whose seal and cord and staff are these?” \n   \n","Judah recognized the items and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not have relations with her again. \n   \n","When the time came for Tamar to give birth, there were twins in her womb. \n","And as she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it around his wrist. “This one came out first,” she announced. \n","But when he pulled his hand back and his brother came out, she said, “You have broken out first!” So he was named Perez. \n","Then his brother came out with the scarlet thread around his wrist, and he was named Zerah. \n"],["Meanwhile, Joseph had been taken down to Egypt, where an Egyptian named Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there. \n","And the LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, serving in the household of his Egyptian master. \n   \n","When his master saw that the LORD was with him and made him prosper in all he did, \n","Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal attendant. \n  Potiphar put him in charge of his household and entrusted him with everything he owned. \n","From the time that he put Joseph in charge of his household and all he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s household on account of him. The LORD’s blessing was on everything he owned, both in his house and in his field. \n","So Potiphar left all that he owned in Joseph’s care; he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. \n  Now Joseph was well-built and handsome, \n","and after some time his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said, “Sleep with me.” \n   \n","But he refused. “Look,” he said to his master’s wife, “with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in his house, and he has entrusted everything he owns to my care. \n","No one in this house is greater than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. So how could I do such a great evil and sin against God?” \n   \n","Although Potiphar’s wife spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be near her. \n","One day, however, Joseph went into the house to attend to his work, and not a single household servant was inside. \n","She grabbed Joseph by his cloak and said, “Sleep with me!” But leaving his cloak in her hand, he escaped and ran outside. \n   \n","When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house, \n","she called her household servants. “Look,” she said, “this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us. He came to me so he could sleep with me, but I screamed as loud as I could. \n","When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.” \n   \n","So Potiphar’s wife kept Joseph’s cloak beside her until his master came home. \n","Then she told him the same story: “The Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me, \n","but when I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.” \n   \n","When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is what your slave did to me,” he burned with anger. \n","So Joseph’s master took him and had him thrown into the prison where the king’s prisoners were confined. \n  While Joseph was there in the prison, \n","the LORD was with him and extended kindness to him, granting him favor in the eyes of the prison warden. \n","And the warden put all the prisoners under Joseph’s care, so that he was responsible for all that was done in the prison. \n","The warden did not concern himself with anything under Joseph’s care, because the LORD was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did. \n"],["Some time later, the king’s cupbearer and baker offended their master, the king of Egypt. \n","Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, \n","and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, the same prison where Joseph was confined. \n","The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he became their personal attendant. \n  After they had been in custody for some time, \n","both of these men—the Egyptian king’s cupbearer and baker, who were being held in the prison—had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning. \n   \n","When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were distraught. \n","So he asked the officials of Pharaoh who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why are your faces so downcast today?” \n   \n","“We both had dreams,” they replied, “but there is no one to interpret them.” \n  Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.” \n   \n","So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream: “In my dream there was a vine before me, \n","and on the vine were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes. \n","Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and placed the cup in his hand.” \n   \n","Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three branches are three days. \n","Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore your position. You will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you did when you were his cupbearer. \n","But when it goes well for you, please remember me and show me kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh, that he might bring me out of this prison. \n","For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing for which they should have put me in this dungeon.” \n   \n","When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: There were three baskets of white bread on my head. \n","In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.” \n   \n","Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days. \n","Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. Then the birds will eat the flesh of your body.” \n   \n","On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he held a feast for all his officials, and in their presence he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. \n","Pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand. \n","But Pharaoh hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had described to them in his interpretation. \n   \n","The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot all about him. \n"],["After two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing beside the Nile, \n","when seven cows, sleek and well-fed, came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds. \n","After them, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came up from the Nile and stood beside the well-fed cows on the bank of the river. \n","And the cows that were sickly and thin devoured the seven sleek, well-fed cows. \n  Then Pharaoh woke up, \n","but he fell back asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, came up on one stalk. \n","After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted, thin and scorched by the east wind. \n","And the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven plump, ripe ones. Then Pharaoh awoke and realized it was a dream. \n   \n","In the morning his spirit was troubled, so he summoned all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him. \n   \n","Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I recall my failures. \n","Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guard. \n","One night both the chief baker and I had dreams, and each dream had its own meaning. \n","Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams and he interpreted them for us individually. \n","And it happened to us just as he had interpreted: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged.” \n   \n","So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, who was quickly brought out of the dungeon. After he had shaved and changed his clothes, he went in before Pharaoh. \n   \n","Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” \n   \n","“I myself cannot do it,” Joseph replied, “but God will give Pharaoh a sound answer.” \n   \n","Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, \n","when seven cows, well-fed and sleek, came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds. \n","After them, seven other cows—sickly, ugly, and thin—came up. I have never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt! \n","Then the thin, ugly cows devoured the seven well-fed cows that were there first. \n","When they had devoured them, however, no one could tell that they had done so; their appearance was as ugly as it had been before. Then I awoke. \n   \n","In my dream I also saw seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, growing on a single stalk. \n","After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind. \n","And the thin heads of grain swallowed the seven plump ones. \n  I told this dream to the magicians, but no one could explain it to me.” \n   \n","At this, Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do. \n","The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven ripe heads of grain are seven years. The dreams have the same meaning. \n","Moreover, the seven thin, ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind—they are seven years of famine. \n   \n","It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. \n","Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt, \n","but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will devastate the land. \n","The abundance in the land will not be remembered, since the famine that follows it will be so severe. \n   \n","Moreover, because the dream was given to Pharaoh in two versions, the matter has been decreed by God, and He will carry it out shortly. \n   \n","Now, therefore, Pharaoh should look for a discerning and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt. \n","Let Pharaoh take action and appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest  of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. \n","Under the authority of Pharaoh, let them collect all the excess food from these good years, that they may come and lay up the grain to be preserved as food in the cities. \n","This food will be a reserve for the land during the seven years of famine to come upon the land of Egypt. Then the country will not perish in the famine.” \n   \n","This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his officials. \n","So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, in whom the Spirit of God  abides?” \n   \n","Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you. \n","You shall be in charge of my house, and all my people are to obey your commands. Only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you.” \n   \n","Pharaoh also told Joseph, “I hereby place you over all the land of Egypt.” \n","Then Pharaoh removed the signet ring from his finger, put it on Joseph’s finger, clothed him in garments of fine linen, and placed a gold chain around his neck. \n","He had Joseph ride in his second chariot, with men calling out before him, “Bow the knee!” So he placed him over all the land of Egypt. \n   \n","And Pharaoh declared to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your permission, no one in all the land of Egypt shall lift his hand or foot.” \n   \n","Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah,  and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph took charge of all the land of Egypt. \n   \n","Now Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout the land of Egypt. \n   \n","During the seven years of abundance, the land brought forth bountifully. \n","During those seven years, Joseph collected all the excess food in the land of Egypt and stored it in the cities. In every city he laid up the food from the fields around it. \n","So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance, like the sand of the sea, that he stopped keeping track of it; for it was beyond measure. \n   \n","Before the years of famine arrived, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. \n","Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, saying, “God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father’s household.” \n","And the second son he named Ephraim, saying, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.” \n   \n","When the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end, \n","the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. And although there was famine in every country, there was food throughout the land of Egypt. \n","When extreme hunger came to all the land of Egypt and the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, he told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.” \n   \n","When the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened up all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians; for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. \n","And every nation came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth. \n"],["When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you staring at one another?” \n   \n","“Look,” he added, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.” \n   \n","So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. \n","But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “I am afraid that harm might befall him.” \n   \n","So the sons of Israel were among those who came to buy grain, since the famine had also spread to the land of Canaan. \n   \n","Now Joseph was the ruler of the land; he was the one who sold grain to all its people. So when his brothers arrived, they bowed down before him with their faces to the ground. \n","And when Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he treated them as strangers and spoke harshly to them. “Where have you come from?” he asked. \n  “From the land of Canaan,” they replied. “We are here to buy food.” \n   \n","Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. \n","Joseph remembered his dreams about them and said, “You are spies! You have come to see if our land is vulnerable.” \n   \n","“Not so, my lord,” they replied. “Your servants have come to buy food. \n","We are all sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.” \n   \n","“No,” he told them. “You have come to see if our land is vulnerable.” \n   \n","But they answered, “Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.” \n   \n","Then Joseph declared, “Just as I said, you are spies! \n","And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. \n","Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be confined so that the truth of your words may be tested. If they are untrue, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!” \n   \n","So Joseph imprisoned them for three days, \n","and on the third day he said to them, “I fear God. So do this and you will live: \n","If you are honest, leave one of your brothers in custody while the rest of you go and take back grain to relieve the hunger of your households. \n","Then bring your youngest brother to me so that your words can be verified, that you may not die.” \n  And to this they consented. \n   \n","Then they said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw his anguish when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.” \n   \n","And Reuben responded, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you would not listen. Now we must account for his blood!” \n   \n","They did not realize that Joseph understood them, since there was an interpreter between them. \n","And he turned away from them and wept. When he turned back and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and had him bound before their eyes. \n   \n","Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return each man’s silver  to his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. This order was carried out, \n","and they loaded the grain on their donkeys and departed. \n   \n","At the place where they lodged for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of the sack. \n","“My silver has been returned!” he said to his brothers. “It is here in my sack.” \n  Their hearts sank, and trembling, they turned to one another and said, “What is this that God has done to us?” \n   \n","When they reached their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they described to him all that had happened to them: \n","“The man who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the country. \n   \n","But we told him, ‘We are honest men, not spies. \n","We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.’ \n   \n","Then the man who is lord of the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether you are honest: Leave one brother with me, take food to relieve the hunger of your households, and go. \n","But bring your youngest brother back to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.’” \n   \n","As they began emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his bag of silver! And when they and their father saw the bags of silver, they were dismayed. \n   \n","Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my sons. Joseph is gone and Simeon is no more. Now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is going against me!” \n   \n","Then Reuben said to his father, “You may kill my two sons if I fail to bring him back to you. Put him in my care, and I will return him.” \n   \n","But Jacob replied, “My son will not go down there with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If any harm comes to him on your journey, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.” \n"],["Now the famine was still severe in the land. \n","So when Jacob’s sons had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little more food.” \n   \n","But Judah replied, “The man solemnly warned us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’ \n","If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you. \n","But if you will not send him, we will not go; for the man told us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’” \n   \n","“Why did you bring this trouble upon me?” Israel asked. “Why did you tell the man you had another brother?” \n   \n","They replied, “The man questioned us in detail about ourselves and our family: ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ And we answered him accordingly. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother here’?” \n   \n","And Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me, and we will go at once, so that we may live and not die—neither we, nor you, nor our children. \n","I will guarantee his safety. You may hold me personally responsible. If I do not bring him back and set him before you, then may I bear the guilt before you all my life. \n","If we had not delayed, we could have come and gone twice by now.” \n   \n","Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your packs and carry them down as a gift for the man—a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachios and almonds. \n","Take double the silver with you so that you may return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake. \n","Take your brother as well, and return to the man at once. \n","May God Almighty  grant you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother along with Benjamin. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.” \n   \n","So the men took these gifts, along with double the amount of silver, and Benjamin as well. Then they hurried down to Egypt and stood before Joseph. \n   \n","When Joseph saw Benjamin with his brothers, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for they shall dine with me at noon.” \n","The man did as Joseph had commanded and took the brothers to Joseph’s house. \n   \n","But the brothers were frightened that they had been taken to Joseph’s house. “We have been brought here because of the silver that was returned in our bags the first time,” they said. “They intend to overpower us and take us as slaves, along with our donkeys.” \n   \n","So they approached Joseph’s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house. \n","“Please, sir,” they said, “we really did come down here the first time to buy food. \n","But when we came to the place we lodged for the night, we opened our sacks and, behold, each of us found his silver in the mouth of his sack! It was the full amount of our silver, and we have brought it back with us. \n","We have brought additional silver with us to buy food. We do not know who put our silver in our sacks.” \n   \n","“It is fine,” said the steward. “Do not be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, gave you the treasure that was in your sacks. I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them. \n","And the steward took the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet, and provided food for their donkeys. \n   \n","Since the brothers had been told that they were going to eat a meal there, they prepared their gift for Joseph’s arrival at noon. \n","When Joseph came home, they presented him with the gifts they had brought, and they bowed to the ground before him. \n   \n","He asked if they were well, and then he asked, “How is your elderly father you told me about? Is he still alive?” \n   \n","“Your servant our father is well,” they answered. “He is still alive.” And they bowed down to honor him. \n   \n","When Joseph looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” Then he declared, “May God be gracious to you, my son.” \n   \n","Joseph hurried out because he was moved to tears for his brother, and he went to a private room to weep. \n","Then he washed his face and came back out. Regaining his composure, he said, “Serve the meal.” \n   \n","They separately served Joseph, his brothers, and the Egyptians. They ate separately because the Egyptians would not eat with the Hebrews, since that was detestable to them. \n","They were seated before Joseph in order by age, from the firstborn to the youngest, and the men looked at one another in astonishment. \n","When the portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times larger than any of the others. So they feasted and drank freely with Joseph. \n"],["Then Joseph instructed his steward: “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each one’s silver in the mouth of his sack. \n","Put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for his grain.” \n  So the steward did as Joseph had instructed. \n   \n","At daybreak, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys. \n","They had not gone far from the city when Joseph told his steward, “Pursue the men at once, and when you overtake them, ask, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil? \n","Is this not the cup  my master drinks from and uses for divination? What you have done is wicked!’” \n   \n","When the steward overtook them, he relayed these words to them. \n   \n","“Why does my lord say these things?” they asked. “Your servants could not possibly do such a thing. \n","We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found in the mouths of our sacks. Why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house? \n","If any of your servants is found to have it, he must die, and the rest will become slaves of my lord.” \n   \n","“As you say,” replied the steward. “But only the one who is found with the cup will be my slave, and the rest of you shall be free of blame.” \n   \n","So each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it. \n","The steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest—and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. \n","Then they all tore their clothes, loaded their donkeys, and returned to the city. \n   \n","When Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph’s house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground before him. \n   \n","“What is this deed you have done?” Joseph declared. “Do you not know that a man like me can surely divine the truth?” \n   \n","“What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “How can we plead? How can we justify ourselves? God has exposed the iniquity of your servants. We are now my lord’s slaves—both we and the one who was found with the cup.” \n   \n","But Joseph replied, “Far be it from me to do this. The man who was found with the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may return to your father in peace.” \n   \n","Then Judah approached Joseph and said, “Sir, please let your servant speak personally to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, for you are equal to Pharaoh himself. \n","My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ \n   \n","And we answered, ‘We have an elderly father and a younger brother, the child of his old age. The boy’s brother is dead. He is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’ \n   \n","Then you told your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so that I can see him for myself.’ \n   \n","So we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he were to leave, his father would die.’ \n   \n","But you said to your servants, ‘Unless your younger brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’ \n   \n","Now when we returned to your servant my father, we relayed your words to him. \n   \n","Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy us some food.’ \n   \n","But we answered, ‘We cannot go down there unless our younger brother goes with us. So if our younger brother is not with us, we cannot see the man.’ \n   \n","And your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons. \n","When one of them was gone, I said: “Surely he has been torn to pieces.” And I have not seen him since. \n","Now if you also take this one from me and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.’ \n   \n","So if the boy is not with us when I return to your servant, and if my father, whose life is wrapped up in the boy’s life, \n","sees that the boy is not with us, he will die. Then your servants will have brought the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow. \n","Indeed, your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father, saying, ‘If I do not return him to you, I will bear the guilt before you, my father, all my life.’ \n   \n","Now please let your servant stay here as my lord’s slave in place of the boy. Let him return with his brothers. \n","For how can I go back to my father without the boy? I could not bear to see the misery that would overwhelm him.” \n"],["Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Send everyone away from me!” \n  So none of them were with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers. \n","But he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh’s household soon heard of it. \n   \n","Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” \n  But they were unable to answer him, because they were terrified in his presence. \n   \n","Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come near me.” And they did so. \n  “I am Joseph, your brother,” he said, “the one you sold into Egypt! \n","And now, do not be distressed or angry with yourselves that you sold me into this place, because it was to save lives that God sent me before you. \n","For the famine has covered the land these two years, and there will be five more years without plowing or harvesting. \n","God sent me before you to preserve you as a remnant on the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. \n","Therefore it was not you who sent me here, but God, who has made me a father to Pharaoh—lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt. \n   \n","Now return quickly to my father and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me without delay. \n","You shall settle in the land of Goshen and be near me—you and your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and everything you own. \n","And there I will provide for you, because there will be five more years of famine. Otherwise, you and your household and everything you own will come to destitution.’ \n   \n","Behold! You and my brother Benjamin can see that I, Joseph, am the one speaking with you. \n","Tell my father about all my splendor in Egypt and everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.” \n   \n","Then Joseph threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept as they embraced. \n","Joseph kissed each of his brothers as he wept over them. And afterward his brothers talked with him. \n   \n","When the news reached Pharaoh’s house that Joseph’s brothers had come, Pharaoh and his servants were pleased. \n   \n","Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do as follows: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan. \n","Then bring your father and your families and return to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat from the fat of the land.’ \n","You are also directed to tell them: ‘Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your young children and your wives, and bring your father and come back. \n","But pay no regard to your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’” \n   \n","So the sons of Israel did as they were told. Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had instructed, and he also gave them provisions for their journey. \n","He gave new garments to each of them, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver  and five sets of clothes. \n","And he sent to his father the following: ten donkeys loaded with the best of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provisions for his father’s journey. \n   \n","Then Joseph sent his brothers on their way, and as they were leaving, he said to them, “Do not quarrel on the way!” \n   \n","So the brothers went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan. \n","“Joseph is still alive,” they said, “and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!” \n  But Jacob was stunned, for he did not believe them. \n","However, when they relayed all that Joseph had told them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob was revived. \n   \n","“Enough!” declared Israel. “My son Joseph is still alive! I will go to see him before I die.” \n"],["So Israel set out with all that he had, and when he came to Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. \n","And that night God spoke to Israel in a vision: “Jacob, Jacob!” He said. \n  “Here I am,” replied Jacob. \n   \n","“I am God,” He said, “the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. \n","I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will surely bring you back. And Joseph’s own hands will close your eyes.” \n   \n","Then Jacob departed from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel took their father Jacob in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to carry him, along with their children and wives. \n","They also took the livestock and possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt. \n   \n","Jacob took with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons, and his daughters and granddaughters—all his offspring. \n   \n","Now these are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn. \n   \n","The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. \n   \n","The sons of Simeon: Jemuel,  Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. \n   \n","The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. \n   \n","The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. \n  The sons of Perez: Hezron and Hamul. \n   \n","The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah,  Job, and Shimron. \n   \n","The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. \n   \n","These are the sons of Leah born to Jacob in Paddan-aram, in addition to his daughter Dinah. The total number of sons and daughters was thirty-three. \n   \n","The sons of Gad: Ziphion,  Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. \n   \n","The children of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. \n  The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. \n   \n","These are the sons of Jacob born to Zilpah—whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah—sixteen in all. \n   \n","The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. \n   \n","Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. \n   \n","The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. \n   \n","These are the sons of Rachel born to Jacob—fourteen in all. \n   \n","The son of Dan: Hushim. \n   \n","The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. \n   \n","These are the sons of Jacob born to Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel—seven in all. \n   \n","All those belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt—his direct descendants, besides the wives of Jacob’s sons—numbered sixty-six persons. \n","And with the two sons   who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob’s family who went to Egypt were seventy  in all. \n   \n","Now Jacob had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When Jacob’s family arrived in the land of Goshen, \n","Joseph prepared his chariot and went there to meet his father Israel. Joseph presented himself to him, embraced him, and wept profusely. \n   \n","Then Israel said to Joseph, “Finally I can die, now that I have seen your face and know that you are still alive!” \n   \n","Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and inform Pharaoh: ‘My brothers and my father’s household from the land of Canaan have come to me. \n","The men are shepherds; they raise livestock, and they have brought their flocks and herds and all that they own.’ \n   \n","When Pharaoh summons you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’ \n","you are to say, ‘Your servants have raised livestock ever since our youth—both we and our fathers.’ Then you will be allowed to settle in the land of Goshen, since all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.” \n"],["So Joseph went and told Pharaoh: “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.” \n   \n","And he chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh. \n   \n","“What is your occupation?” Pharaoh asked Joseph’s brothers. \n  “Your servants are shepherds,” they replied, “both we and our fathers.” \n   \n","Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live in the land for a time, because there is no pasture for the flocks of your servants, since the famine in the land of Canaan has been severe. So now, please allow your servants to settle in the land of Goshen.” \n   \n","Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now that your father and brothers have come to you, \n","the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land. They may dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know of any talented men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock.” \n   \n","Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. \n   \n","“How many years have you lived?” Pharaoh asked. \n   \n","“My travels  have lasted 130 years,” Jacob replied. “My years have been few and hard, and they have not matched the years of the travels of my fathers.” \n   \n","Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and departed from his presence. \n   \n","So Joseph settled his father and brothers in the land of Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. \n","Joseph also provided his father and brothers and all his father’s household with food for their families. \n   \n","There was no food, however, in all that region, because the famine was so severe; the lands of Egypt and Canaan had been exhausted by the famine. \n","Joseph collected all the money to be found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain they were buying, and he brought it into Pharaoh’s palace. \n","When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our funds have run out!” \n   \n","“Then bring me your livestock,” said Joseph. “Since the money is gone, I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock.” \n","So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their flocks and herds, and their donkeys. Throughout that year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock. \n   \n","When that year was over, they came to him the second year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord that our money is gone and all our livestock belongs to you. There is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land. \n","Why should we perish before your eyes—we and our land as well? Purchase us and our land in exchange for food. Then we, along with our land, will be slaves to Pharaoh. Give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.” \n   \n","So Joseph acquired for Pharaoh all the land in Egypt; the Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields because the famine was so severe upon them. The land became Pharaoh’s, \n","and Joseph reduced the people to servitude  from one end of Egypt to the other. \n","However, he did not acquire the priests’ portion of the land, for it had been given to them by Pharaoh. They ate the rations that Pharaoh supplied; so they did not sell their land. \n   \n","Then Joseph said to the people, “Now that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh this day, here is seed for you to sow in the land. \n","At harvest time, you are to give a fifth of it to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be yours as seed for the field and food for yourselves and your households and children.” \n   \n","“You have saved our lives,” they said. “We have found favor in our lord’s eyes, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.” \n","So Joseph established a law that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh, and it is in effect in the land of Egypt to this day. Only the priests’ land does not belong to Pharaoh. \n   \n","Now the Israelites settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and became fruitful and increased greatly in number. \n","And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the length of his life was 147 years. \n   \n","When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise to show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt, \n","but when I lie down with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me with them.” \n  Joseph answered, “I will do as you have requested.” \n   \n","“Swear to me,” Jacob said. \n  So Joseph swore to him, and Israel bowed in worship at the head of his bed. \n"],["Some time later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he set out with his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. \n","When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel rallied his strength and sat up in bed. \n   \n","Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty  appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there He blessed me \n","and told me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you; I will make you a multitude of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.’ \n   \n","And now your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here shall be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. \n","Any children born to you after them shall be yours, and they shall be called by the names of their brothers in the territory they inherit. \n   \n","Now as for me, when I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died along the way in the land of Canaan, some distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem). \n   \n","When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?” \n   \n","Joseph said to his father, “They are the sons God has given me in this place.” \n  So Jacob said, “Please bring them to me, that I may bless them.” \n   \n","Now Israel’s eyesight was poor because of old age; he could hardly see. Joseph brought his sons to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. \n   \n","“I never expected to see your face again,” Israel said to Joseph, “but now God has let me see your children as well.” \n   \n","Then Joseph removed his sons from his father’s knees and bowed facedown. \n   \n","And Joseph took both of them—with Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand—and brought them close to him. \n","But Israel stretched out his right hand and put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger; and crossing his hands, he put his left on Manasseh’s head, although Manasseh was the firstborn. \n","Then he blessed Joseph and said: \n  “May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, \n the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, \n  \n","the angel  who has redeemed me from all harm—\n may He bless these boys. \n And may they be called by my name \n and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, \n and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.” \n   \n","When Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he was displeased and took his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s. \n","“Not so, my father!” Joseph said. “This one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.” \n   \n","But his father refused. “I know, my son, I know!” he said. “He too shall become a people, and he too shall be great; nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.” \n   \n","So that day Jacob blessed them and said: \n  “By you shall Israel pronounce this blessing: \n ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’” \n  So he put Ephraim before Manasseh. \n   \n","Then Israel said to Joseph, “Look, I am about to die, but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers. \n","And to you, as one who is above your brothers, I give the ridge of land  that I took from the Amorites with my sword and bow.” \n"],["Then Jacob called for his sons and said, “Gather around so that I can tell you what will happen to you in the days to come: \n   \n","Come together and listen, O sons of Jacob; \n listen to your father Israel. \n   \n","Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, \n and the beginning of my strength, \n excelling in honor, \n excelling in power. \n  \n","Uncontrolled as the waters, \n you will no longer excel, \n because you went up to your father’s bed, \n onto my couch, and defiled it. \n   \n","Simeon and Levi are brothers; \n their swords  are weapons of violence. \n  \n","May I never enter their council; \n may I never join their assembly. \n For they kill men in their anger, \n and hamstring oxen on a whim. \n  \n","Cursed be their anger, for it is strong, \n and their wrath, for it is cruel! \n I will disperse them in Jacob \n and scatter them in Israel. \n   \n","Judah, your brothers shall praise you. \n Your hand shall be on the necks of your enemies; \n your father’s sons shall bow down to you. \n  \n","Judah is a young lion—\n my son, you return from the prey. \n Like a lion he crouches and lies down; \n like a lioness, who dares to rouse him?

I will provide for you and your little ones.” So Joseph reassured his brothers and spoke kindly to them. \n   \n","Now Joseph and his father’s household remained in Egypt, and Joseph lived to the age of 110. \n","He saw Ephraim’s sons to the third generation, and indeed the sons of Machir son of Manasseh were brought up  on Joseph’s knees. \n   \n","Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely visit you and bring you up from this land to the land He promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” \n","And Joseph made the sons of Israel take an oath and said, “God will surely attend to you, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.” \n   \n","So Joseph died at the age of 110.

As a result, they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. \n","But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and flourished; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites. \n   \n","They worked the Israelites ruthlessly \n","and made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar, and with all kinds of work in the fields. Every service they imposed was harsh. \n   \n","Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, \n","“When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them on the birthstools. If the child is a son, kill him; but if it is a daughter, let her live.” \n   \n","The midwives, however, feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had instructed; they let the boys live. \n","So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?” \n   \n","The midwives answered Pharaoh, “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before a midwife arrives.” \n   \n","So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied and became even more numerous. \n","And because the midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own. \n   \n","Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: “Every son born to the Hebrews  you must throw into the Nile, but every daughter you may allow to live.” \n"],["Now a man of the house of Levi married a daughter of Levi, \n","and she conceived and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him for three months. \n   \n","But when she could no longer hide him, she got him a papyrus basket  and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in the basket and set it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile. \n","And his sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him. \n   \n","Soon the daughter of Pharaoh went down to bathe in the Nile, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. And when she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her maidservant to retrieve it. \n","When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the little boy was crying. So she had compassion on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrew children.” \n   \n","Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call one of the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” \n   \n","“Go ahead,” Pharaoh’s daughter told her. And the girl went and called the boy’s mother. \n   \n","Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages.” So the woman took the boy and nursed him. \n   \n","When the child had grown older, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses  and explained, “I drew him out of the water.” \n   \n","One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his own people  and observed their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. \n","After looking this way and that and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand. \n   \n","The next day Moses went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you attacking your companion?” \n   \n","But the man replied, “Who made you ruler and judge over us?  Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? ” \n  Then Moses was afraid and thought, “This thing I have done has surely become known.” \n   \n","When Pharaoh heard about this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, where he sat down beside a well. \n   \n","Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock. \n","And when some shepherds came along and drove them away, Moses rose up to help them and watered their flock. \n   \n","When the daughters returned to their father Reuel, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?” \n   \n","“An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds,” they replied. “He even drew water for us and watered the flock.” \n   \n","“So where is he?” their father asked. “Why did you leave the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat.” \n   \n","Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage. \n","And she gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.” \n   \n","After a long time, the king of Egypt died.

I have heard them crying out because of their oppressors, and I am aware of their sufferings. \n","I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. \n   \n","And now the cry of the Israelites has reached Me, and I have seen how severely the Egyptians are oppressing them. \n","Therefore, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring My people the Israelites out of Egypt.” \n   \n","But Moses asked God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” \n   \n","“I will surely be with you,” God said, “and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, all of you will worship God on this mountain.” \n   \n","Then Moses asked God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ What should I tell them?” \n   \n","God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’” \n   \n","God also told Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ This is My name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered in every generation. \n   \n","Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—has appeared to me and said: I have surely attended to you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt. \n","And I have promised to bring you up out of your affliction in Egypt, into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’ \n   \n","The elders of Israel will listen to what you say, and you must go with them to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.’ \n   \n","But I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go unless a mighty hand compels him. \n","So I will stretch out My hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders I will perform among them. And after that, he will release you. \n   \n","And I will grant this people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that when you leave, you will not go away empty-handed. \n","Every woman shall ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing, and you will put them on your sons and daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians.” \n"],["Then Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to my voice? For they may say, ‘The LORD has not appeared to you.’” \n   \n","And the LORD asked him, “What is that in your hand?” \n  “A staff,” he replied. \n   \n","“Throw it on the ground,” said the LORD. So Moses threw it on the ground, and it became a snake, and he ran from it. \n   \n","“Stretch out your hand and grab it by the tail,” the LORD said to Moses, who reached out his hand and caught the snake, and it turned back into a staff in his hand. \n","“This is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.” \n   \n","Furthermore, the LORD said to Moses, “Put your hand inside your cloak. ” So he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, white as snow. \n   \n","“Put your hand back inside your cloak,” said the LORD. \n  So Moses put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his skin. \n   \n","And the LORD said, “If they refuse to believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe that of the second. \n","But if they do not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. Then the water you take from the Nile will become blood on the ground.” \n   \n","“Please, Lord,” Moses replied, “I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since You have spoken to Your servant, for I am slow of speech and tongue.” \n   \n","And the LORD said to him, “Who gave man his mouth? Or who makes the mute or the deaf, the sighted or the blind? Is it not I, the LORD? \n","Now go! I will help you as you speak, and I will teach you what to say.” \n   \n","But Moses replied, “Please, Lord, send someone else.” \n   \n","Then the anger of the LORD burned against Moses, and He said, “Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well, and he is now on his way to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. \n","You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth. I will help both of you to speak, and I will teach you what to do. \n","He will speak to the people for you. He will be your spokesman, and it will be as if you were God to him. \n","But take this staff in your hand so you can perform signs with it.” \n   \n","Then Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro  and said to him, “Please let me return to my brothers in Egypt to see if they are still alive.” \n  “Go in peace,” Jethro replied. \n   \n","Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who sought to kill you are dead.” \n","So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and headed back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand. \n   \n","The LORD instructed Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put within your power. But I will harden  his heart so that he will not let the people go. \n   \n","Then tell Pharaoh that this is what the LORD says: ‘Israel is My firstborn son, \n","and I told you to let My son go so that he may worship Me.

I do not know the LORD, and I will not let Israel go.” \n   \n","“The God of the Hebrews has met with us,” they answered. “Please let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to the LORD our God, or He may strike us with plagues or with the sword.” \n   \n","But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get back to your labor!” \n","Pharaoh also said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you would be stopping them from their labor.” \n   \n","That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen: \n","“You shall no longer supply the people with straw for making bricks. They must go and gather their own straw. \n","But require of them the same quota of bricks as before; do not reduce it. For they are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ \n","Make the work harder on the men so they will be occupied and pay no attention to these lies.” \n   \n","So the taskmasters and foremen of the people went out and said to them, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I am no longer giving you straw. \n","Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it; but your workload will in no way be reduced.’” \n   \n","So the people scattered all over the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. \n","The taskmasters kept pressing them, saying, “Fulfill your quota each day, just as you did when straw was provided.” \n   \n","Then the Israelite foremen, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over the people, were beaten and asked, “Why have you not fulfilled your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as you did before?” \n   \n","So the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why are you treating your servants this way? \n","No straw has been given to your servants, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Look, your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.” \n   \n","“You are slackers!” Pharaoh replied. “Slackers! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’ \n","Now get to work. You will be given no straw, yet you must deliver the full quota of bricks.” \n   \n","The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks.” \n","When they left Pharaoh, they confronted Moses and Aaron, who stood waiting to meet them. \n   \n","“May the LORD look upon you and judge you,” the foremen said, “for you have made us a stench before Pharaoh and his officials; you have placed in their hand a sword to kill us!” \n   \n","So Moses returned to the LORD and asked, “Lord, why have You brought trouble upon this people? Is this why You sent me? \n","Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and You have not delivered Your people in any way.” \n"],["But the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for because of My mighty hand he will let the people go; because of My strong hand he will drive them out of his land.” \n   \n","God also told Moses, “I am the LORD. \n","I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by My name the LORD I did not make Myself known to them. \n","I also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they lived as foreigners. \n","Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered My covenant. \n   \n","Therefore tell the Israelites: ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage.

Clearly you are bent on evil. \n","No, only the men may go and worship the LORD, since that is what you have been requesting.” And Moses and Aaron were driven from Pharaoh’s presence. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt, so that the locusts may swarm over it and devour every plant in the land—everything that the hail has left behind.” \n   \n","So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and throughout that day and night the LORD sent an east wind across the land. By morning the east wind had brought the locusts. \n   \n","The locusts swarmed across the land and settled over the entire territory of Egypt. Never before had there been so many locusts, and never again will there be. \n","They covered the face of all the land until it was black, and they consumed all the plants on the ground and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left behind.

Not a single locust remained anywhere in Egypt. \n   \n","But the LORD hardened  Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that darkness may spread over the land of Egypt—a palpable darkness.” \n   \n","So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and total darkness covered all the land of Egypt for three days. \n","No one could see anyone else, and for three days no one left his place. Yet all the Israelites had light in their dwellings. \n   \n","Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the LORD. Even your little ones may go with you; only your flocks and herds must stay behind.” \n   \n","But Moses replied, “You must also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God. \n","Even our livestock must go with us; not a hoof will be left behind, for we will need some of them to worship the LORD our God, and we will not know how we are to worship the LORD until we arrive.” \n   \n","But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was unwilling to let them go. \n","“Depart from me!” Pharaoh said to Moses. “Make sure you never see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die.” \n   \n","“As you say,” Moses replied, “I will never see your face again.” \n"],["Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will bring upon Pharaoh and Egypt one more plague. After that, he will allow you to leave this place. And when he lets you go, he will drive you out completely. \n","Now announce to the people that men and women alike should ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.” \n   \n","And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people. \n   \n","So Moses declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt, \n","and every firstborn son in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, to the firstborn of the servant girl behind the hand mill, as well as the firstborn of all the cattle. \n","Then a great cry will go out over all the land of Egypt. Such an outcry has never been heard before and will never be heard again. \n","But among all the Israelites, not even a dog will snarl at man or beast.’ \n  Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. \n","And all these officials of yours will come and bow before me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that, I will depart.” \n  And hot with anger, Moses left Pharaoh’s presence. \n   \n","The LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.” \n   \n","Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened  Pharaoh’s heart so that he would not let the Israelites go out of his land. \n"],["Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, \n","“This month is the beginning of months for you; it shall be the first month of your year. \n   \n","Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man must select a lamb  for his family, one per household. \n","If the household is too small for a whole lamb, they are to share with the nearest neighbor based on the number of people, and apportion the lamb accordingly. \n   \n","Your lamb must be an unblemished year-old male, and you may take it from the sheep or the goats. \n","You must keep it until the fourteenth day of the month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel will slaughter the animals at twilight. \n","They are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes  of the houses where they eat the lambs. \n   \n","They are to eat the meat that night, roasted over the fire, along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. \n   \n","Do not eat any of the meat raw or cooked in boiling water, but only roasted over the fire—its head and legs and inner parts. \n","Do not leave any of it until morning; before the morning you must burn up any part that is left over. \n   \n","This is how you are to eat it: You must be fully dressed for travel, with your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. You are to eat in haste; it is the LORD’s Passover. \n   \n","On that night I will pass through the land of Egypt and strike down every firstborn male, both man and beast, and I will execute judgment against all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD. \n","The blood on the houses where you are staying will distinguish them; when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No plague will fall on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt. \n   \n","And this day will be a memorial for you, and you are to celebrate it as a feast to the LORD, as a permanent statute for the generations to come. \n","For seven days you must eat unleavened bread. On the first day you are to remove the leaven from your houses. Whoever eats anything leavened from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel. \n   \n","On the first day you are to hold a sacred assembly, and another on the seventh day. You must not do any work on those days, except to prepare the meals—that is all you may do. \n   \n","So you are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your divisions out of the land of Egypt. You must keep this day as a permanent statute for the generations to come. \n","In the first month you are to eat unleavened bread, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day. \n","For seven days there must be no leaven found in your houses. If anyone eats something leavened, that person, whether a foreigner or native of the land, must be cut off from the congregation of Israel. \n","You are not to eat anything leavened; eat unleavened bread in all your homes.” \n   \n","Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and told them, “Go at once and select for yourselves a lamb for each family, and slaughter the Passover lamb. \n","Take a cluster of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin, and brush the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out the door of his house until morning. \n   \n","When the LORD passes through to strike down the Egyptians, He will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway; so He will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down. \n   \n","And you are to keep this command as a permanent statute for you and your descendants. \n","When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as He promised, you are to keep this service. \n   \n","When your children ask you, ‘What does this service mean to you?’ \n","you are to reply, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He struck down the Egyptians and spared our homes.’” \n  Then the people bowed down and worshiped. \n","And the Israelites went and did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. \n   \n","Now at midnight the LORD struck down every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner in the dungeon, as well as all the firstborn among the livestock. \n   \n","During the night Pharaoh got up—he and all his officials and all the Egyptians—and there was loud wailing in Egypt; for there was no house without someone dead. \n   \n","Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said, “Get up, leave my people, both you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested. \n","Take your flocks and herds as well, just as you have said, and depart! And bless me also.” \n   \n","And in order to send them out of the land quickly, the Egyptians urged the people on. “For otherwise,” they said, “we are all going to die!” \n","So the people took their dough before it was leavened, carrying it on their shoulders in kneading bowls wrapped in clothing. \n   \n","Furthermore, the Israelites acted on Moses’ word and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold, and for clothing. \n","And the LORD gave the people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that they granted their request. In this way they plundered the Egyptians. \n   \n","The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth  with about 600,000 men on foot, besides women and children. \n","And a mixed multitude also went up with them, along with great droves of livestock, both flocks and herds. \n   \n","Since their dough had no leaven, the people baked what they had brought out of Egypt into unleavened loaves. For when they had been driven out of Egypt, they could not delay and had not prepared any provisions for themselves. \n   \n","Now the duration of the Israelites’ stay in Egypt  was 430 years. \n","At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD’s divisions went out of the land of Egypt. \n","Because the LORD kept a vigil that night to bring them out of the land of Egypt, this same night is to be a vigil to the LORD, to be observed by all the Israelites for the generations to come. \n   \n","And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: No foreigner is to eat of it. \n","But any slave who has been purchased may eat of it, after you have circumcised him. \n","A temporary resident or hired hand shall not eat the Passover. \n   \n","It must be eaten inside one house. You are not to take any of the meat outside the house, and you may not break any of the bones. \n   \n","The whole congregation of Israel must celebrate it. \n","If a foreigner resides with you and wants to celebrate the LORD’s Passover, all the males in the household must be circumcised; then he may come near to celebrate it, and he shall be like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised man may eat of it. \n","The same law shall apply to both the native and the foreigner who resides among you.” \n   \n","Then all the Israelites did this—they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. \n","And on that very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions. \n"],["Then the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Consecrate to Me every firstborn male. The firstborn from every womb among the Israelites belongs to Me, both of man and beast.” \n   \n","So Moses told the people, “Remember this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; for the LORD brought you out of it by the strength of His hand. And nothing leavened shall be eaten. \n   \n","Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving. \n","And when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites—the land He swore to your fathers that He would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you shall keep this service in this month. \n   \n","For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD. \n","Unleavened bread shall be eaten during those seven days. Nothing leavened may be found among you, nor shall leaven be found anywhere within your borders. \n   \n","And on that day you are to explain to your son, ‘This is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’ \n","It shall be a sign for you on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the Law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For with a mighty hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt. \n","Therefore you shall keep this statute at the appointed time year after year. \n   \n","And after the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as He swore to you and your fathers, \n","you are to present to the LORD the firstborn male of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the LORD. \n","You must redeem every firstborn donkey with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, you are to break its neck. And every firstborn of your sons you must redeem. \n   \n","In the future, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ you are to tell him, ‘With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. \n","And when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both of man and beast. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the firstborn male of every womb, but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons.’ \n","So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead, for with a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.” \n   \n","When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them along the road through the land of the Philistines, though it was shorter. For God said, “If the people face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.” \n","So God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea.  And the Israelites left the land of Egypt arrayed for battle. \n   \n","Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear a solemn oath when he said, “God will surely attend to you, and then you must carry my bones with you from this place.” \n   \n","They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness. \n","And the LORD went before them in a pillar of cloud to guide their way by day, and in a pillar of fire to give them light by night, so that they could travel by day or night. \n","Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place before the people. \n"],["Then the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal-zephon. \n   \n","For Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, ‘They are wandering the land in confusion; the wilderness has boxed them in.’ \n","And I will harden  Pharaoh’s heart so that he will pursue them. But I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.” \n  So this is what the Israelites did. \n   \n","When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have released Israel from serving us.” \n   \n","So Pharaoh prepared his chariot and took his army with him. \n","He took 600 of the best chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them. \n   \n","And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out defiantly. \n","The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen and troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon. \n   \n","As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians marching after them, and they were terrified and cried out to the LORD. \n","They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us into the wilderness to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? \n","Did we not say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.” \n   \n","But Moses told the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the LORD’s salvation, which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians you see today, you will never see again. \n","The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to go forward. \n","And as for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground. \n","And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. Then I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army and chariots and horsemen. \n","The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I am honored through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.” \n   \n","And the angel  of God, who had gone before the camp of Israel, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from before them and stood behind them, \n","so that it came between the camps of Egypt and Israel. The cloud was there in the darkness, but it lit up the night. So all night long neither camp went near the other. \n   \n","Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove back the sea with a strong east wind that turned it into dry land. So the waters were divided, \n","and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left. \n   \n","And the Egyptians chased after them—all Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen—and followed them into the sea. \n","At morning watch, however, the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud, and He threw their camp into confusion. \n","He caused their chariot wheels to wobble, so that they had difficulty driving. “Let us flee from the Israelites,” said the Egyptians, “for the LORD is fighting for them against Egypt!” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.” \n","So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal state. As the Egyptians were retreating, the LORD swept them into the sea. \n","The waters flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had chased the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived. \n   \n","But the Israelites had walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left. \n","That day the LORD saved Israel from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore. \n","When Israel saw the great power that the LORD had exercised over the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and believed in Him and in His servant Moses. \n"],["Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: \n  “I will sing to the LORD, \n for He is highly exalted. \n The horse and rider \n He has thrown into the sea. \n  \n","The LORD is my strength and my song, \n and He has become my salvation. \n He is my God, and I will praise Him, \n my father’s God, and I will exalt Him. \n   \n","The LORD is a warrior, \n the LORD is His name. \n  \n","Pharaoh’s chariots and army \n He has cast into the sea; \n the finest of his officers \n are drowned in the Red Sea. \n  \n","The depths have covered them; \n they sank there like a stone. \n   \n","Your right hand, O LORD, \n is majestic in power; \n Your right hand, O LORD, \n has shattered the enemy. \n  \n","You overthrew Your adversaries \n by Your great majesty. \n You unleashed Your burning wrath; \n it consumed them like stubble. \n  \n","At the blast of Your nostrils \n the waters piled up; \n like a wall the currents stood firm; \n the depths congealed in the heart of the sea. \n   \n","The enemy declared, \n ‘I will pursue, I will overtake. \n I will divide the spoils; \n I will gorge myself on them. \n I will draw my sword; \n my hand will destroy them.’ \n  \n","But You blew with Your breath, \n and the sea covered them. \n They sank like lead \n in the mighty waters. \n   \n","Who among the gods is like You, O LORD? \n Who is like You—majestic in holiness, \n revered with praises, \n performing wonders? \n  \n","You stretched out Your right hand, \n and the earth swallowed them up. \n  \n","With loving devotion  You will lead \n the people You have redeemed; \n with Your strength You will guide them \n to Your holy dwelling. \n   \n","The nations will hear and tremble; \n anguish will grip the dwellers of Philistia. \n  \n","Then the chiefs of Edom will be dismayed; \n trembling will seize the leaders of Moab; \n those who dwell in Canaan will melt away, \n  \n","and terror and dread will fall on them. \n By the power of Your arm \n they will be as still as a stone \n until Your people pass by, O LORD, \n until the people You have bought pass by. \n   \n","You will bring them in and plant them \n on the mountain of Your inheritance—\n the place, O LORD, You have prepared for Your dwelling, \n the sanctuary, O Lord, Your hands have established. \n   \n","The LORD will reign forever and ever!” \n   \n","For when Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them. But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground. \n   \n","Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing. \n","And Miriam sang back to them: \n  “Sing to the LORD, \n for He is highly exalted; \n the horse and rider \n He has thrown into the sea.” \n   \n","Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the Desert of Shur. For three days they walked in the desert without finding water. \n","And when they came to Marah, they could not drink the water there because it was bitter. (That is why it was named Marah.) \n   \n","So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?” \n","And Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a log. And when he cast it into the waters, they were sweetened. \n  There the LORD made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He tested them, \n","saying, “If you will listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His eyes, and pay attention to His commands, and keep all His statutes, then I will not bring on you any of the diseases I inflicted on the Egyptians. For I am the LORD who heals you.” \n   \n","Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there by the waters. \n"],["On the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left the land of Egypt, the whole congregation of Israel set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai. \n","And there in the desert they all grumbled against Moses and Aaron. \n","“If only we had died by the LORD’s hand in the land of Egypt!” they said. “There we sat by pots of meat and ate our fill of bread, but you have brought us into this desert to starve this whole assembly to death!” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain down bread from heaven for you. Each day the people are to go out and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test whether or not they will follow My instructions. \n","Then on the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on the other days.” \n   \n","So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “This evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, \n","and in the morning you will see the LORD’s glory, because He has heard your grumbling against Him. For who are we that you should grumble against us?” \n   \n","And Moses added, “The LORD will give you meat to eat this evening and bread to fill you in the morning, for He has heard your grumbling against Him. Who are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD.” \n   \n","Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole congregation of Israel, ‘Come before the LORD, for He has heard your grumbling.’” \n   \n","And as Aaron was speaking to the whole congregation of Israel, they looked toward the desert, and there in a cloud the glory of the LORD appeared. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, \n","“I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight  you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.’” \n   \n","That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. \n","When the layer of dew had evaporated, there were thin flakes on the desert floor, as fine as frost on the ground. \n","When the Israelites saw it, they asked one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. \n  So Moses told them, “It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat. \n","This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Each one is to gather as much as he needs. You may take an omer  for each person in your tent.’” \n   \n","So the Israelites did this. Some gathered more, and some less. \n","When they measured it by the omer, he who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no shortfall. Each one gathered as much as he needed to eat. \n   \n","Then Moses said to them, “No one may keep any of it until morning.” \n","But they did not listen to Moses; some people left part of it until morning, and it became infested with maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them. \n   \n","Every morning each one gathered as much as was needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away. \n   \n","On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much food—two omers per person  —and all the leaders of the congregation came and reported this to Moses. \n","He told them, “This is what the LORD has said: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of complete rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil. Then set aside whatever remains and keep it until morning.’” \n   \n","So they set it aside until morning as Moses had commanded, and it did not smell or contain any maggots. \n","“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. Today you will not find anything in the field. \n","For six days you may gather, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, it will not be there.” \n   \n","Yet on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they did not find anything. \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and instructions? \n","Understand that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day He will give you bread for two days. On the seventh day, everyone must stay where he is; no one may leave his place.” \n   \n","So the people rested on the seventh day. \n   \n","Now the house of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey. \n","Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Keep an omer of manna for the generations to come, so that they may see the bread I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’” \n   \n","So Moses told Aaron, “Take a jar and fill it with an omer of manna. Then place it before the LORD to be preserved for the generations to come.” \n","And Aaron placed it in front of the Testimony, to be preserved just as the LORD had commanded Moses. \n   \n","The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land where they could settle; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan. \n","(Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.) \n"],["Then the whole congregation of Israel left the Desert of Sin, moving from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. \n","So the people contended with Moses, “Give us water to drink.” \n  “Why do you contend with me?” Moses replied. “Why do you test the LORD?” \n   \n","But the people thirsted for water there, and they grumbled against Moses: “Why have you brought us out of Egypt—to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?” \n   \n","Then Moses cried out to the LORD, “What should I do with these people? A little more and they will stone me!” \n   \n","And the LORD said to Moses, “Walk on ahead of the people and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Take along in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. \n","Behold, I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. And when you strike the rock, water will come out of it for the people to drink.” \n  So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel. \n","He named the place Massah   and Meribah  because the Israelites quarreled, and because they tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?” \n   \n","After this, the Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. \n","So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites.

Then Aaron and Hur held his hands up, one on each side, so that his hands remained steady until the sun went down. \n   \n","So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his army with the sword. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as a reminder and recite it to Joshua, because I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.” \n   \n","And Moses built an altar and named it The LORD Is My Banner. \n","“Indeed,” he said, “a hand was lifted up toward the throne of the LORD.

Then they can bring you any major issue, but all minor cases they can judge on their own, so that your load may be lightened as they share it with you. \n   \n","If you follow this advice and God so directs you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people can go home in peace.” \n   \n","Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. \n","So Moses chose capable men from all Israel and made them heads over the people as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. \n","And they judged the people at all times; they would bring the difficult cases to Moses, but any minor issue they would judge themselves. \n   \n","Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own land. \n"],["In the third month, on the same day of the month  that the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai. \n","After they had set out from Rephidim, they entered the Wilderness of Sinai, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain. \n   \n","Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, “This is what you are to tell the house of Jacob and explain to the sons of Israel: \n","‘You have seen for yourselves what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself. \n","Now if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, you will be My treasured possession out of all the nations—for the whole earth is Mine. \n","And unto Me you shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you are to speak to the Israelites.” \n   \n","So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him. \n","And all the people answered together, “We will do everything that the LORD has spoken.” \n  So Moses brought their words back to the LORD. \n   \n","The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak with you, and they will always put their trust in you.” \n  And Moses relayed to the LORD what the people had said. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow.

But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people; otherwise, I might destroy you on the way.” \n   \n","When the people heard these bad tidings, they went into mourning, and no one put on any of his jewelry. \n","For the LORD had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I should go with you for a single moment, I would destroy you. Now take off your jewelry, and I will decide what to do with you.’” \n   \n","So the Israelites stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward. \n   \n","Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it at a distance outside the camp. He called it the Tent of Meeting, and anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the Tent of Meeting outside the camp. \n","Then, whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would stand at the entrances to their own tents and watch Moses until he entered the tent. \n","As Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and remain at the entrance, and the LORD would speak with Moses. \n","When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they would stand up and worship, each one at the entrance to his own tent. \n   \n","Thus the LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young assistant Joshua son of Nun would not leave the tent. \n   \n","Then Moses said to the LORD, “Look, You have been telling me, ‘Lead this people up,’ but You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have found favor in My sight.’ \n","Now if indeed I have found favor in Your sight, please let me know Your ways, that I may know You and find favor in Your sight. Remember that this nation is Your people.” \n   \n","And the LORD answered, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.” \n   \n","“If Your Presence does not go with us,” Moses replied, “do not lead us up from here. \n","For how then can it be known that Your people and I have found favor in Your sight, unless You go with us? How else will we be distinguished from all the other people on the face of the earth?” \n   \n","So the LORD said to Moses, “I will do this very thing you have asked, for you have found favor in My sight, and I know you by name.” \n   \n","Then Moses said, “Please show me Your glory.” \n   \n","“I will cause all My goodness to pass before you,” the LORD replied, “and I will proclaim My name—the LORD—in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” \n   \n","But He added, “You cannot see My face, for no one can see Me and live.” \n   \n","The LORD continued, “There is a place near Me where you are to stand upon a rock, \n","and when My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by. \n","Then I will take My hand away, and you will see My back; but My face must not be seen.” \n"],["Then the LORD said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the originals, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. \n","Be ready in the morning, and come up on Mount Sinai to present yourself before Me on the mountaintop. \n","No one may go up with you; in fact, no one may be seen anywhere on the mountain—not even the flocks or herds may graze in front of the mountain.” \n   \n","So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the originals. He rose early in the morning, and taking the two stone tablets in his hands, he went up Mount Sinai as the LORD had commanded him. \n   \n","And the LORD descended in a cloud, stood with him there, and proclaimed His name, the LORD. \n","Then the LORD passed in front of Moses and called out: \n “The LORD, the LORD God, \n is compassionate and gracious, \n slow to anger, \n abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness, \n  \n","maintaining loving devotion to a thousand generations, \n forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin. \n Yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished; \n He will visit the iniquity of the fathers \n on their children and grandchildren \n to the third and fourth generations.” \n   \n","Moses immediately bowed down to the ground and worshiped. \n","“O Lord,” he said, “if I have indeed found favor in Your sight, my Lord, please go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our iniquity and sin, and take us as Your inheritance.” \n   \n","And the LORD said, “Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will perform wonders that have never been done in any nation in all the world. All the people among whom you live will see the LORD’s work, for it is an awesome thing that I am doing with you. \n   \n","Observe what I command you this day. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. \n","Be careful not to make a treaty  with the inhabitants of the land you are entering, lest they become a snare in your midst. \n","Rather, you must tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, and chop down their Asherah poles. \n","For you must not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. \n   \n","Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you, and you will eat their sacrifices. \n","And when you take some of their daughters as brides for your sons, their daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods and cause your sons to do the same. \n   \n","You shall make no molten gods for yourselves. \n   \n","You are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread.  For seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib, you are to eat unleavened bread as I commanded you. For in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt. \n   \n","The first offspring of every womb belongs to Me, including all the firstborn males among your livestock, whether cattle or sheep. \n","You must redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb; but if you do not redeem it, you are to break its neck. You must redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one shall appear before Me empty-handed. \n   \n","Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even in the seasons of plowing and harvesting, you must rest. \n   \n","And you are to celebrate the Feast of Weeks   with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering  at the turn of the year. \n","Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. \n","For I will drive out the nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the LORD your God. \n   \n","Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to Me along with anything leavened, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning. \n   \n","Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. \n  You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.” \n   \n","The LORD also said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.” \n   \n","So Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water.

He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it so that atonement could be made on it. \n   \n","Moses also took all the fat that was on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it all on the altar. \n","But the bull with its hide, flesh, and dung he burned outside the camp, as the LORD had commanded him. \n   \n","Then Moses presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. \n","Moses slaughtered the ram and sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar. \n","He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces, and the fat. \n","He washed the entrails and legs with water and burned the entire ram on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. \n   \n","After that, Moses presented the other ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. \n","Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on Aaron’s right earlobe, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. \n","Moses also presented Aaron’s sons and put some of the blood on their right earlobes, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar. \n   \n","And Moses took the fat—the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with their fat—as well as the right thigh. \n","And from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD, he took one cake of unleavened bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer, and he placed them on the fat portions and on the right thigh. \n","He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and waved them before the LORD as a wave offering. \n   \n","Then Moses took these from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD. \n","He also took the breast—Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination—and waved it before the LORD as a wave offering, as the LORD had commanded him. \n   \n","Next, Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments, as well as Aaron’s sons and their garments. \n   \n","And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’ \n","Then you must burn up the remainder of the meat and bread. \n   \n","You must not go outside the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are complete; for it will take seven days to ordain you. \n","What has been done today has been commanded by the LORD in order to make atonement on your behalf. \n","You must remain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days and keep the LORD’s charge so that you will not die, for this is what I have been commanded.” \n   \n","So Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD had commanded through Moses. \n"],["On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. \n","He said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and present them before the LORD. \n","Then speak to the Israelites and say, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb—both a year old and without blemish—for a burnt offering, \n","an ox  and a ram for a peace offering to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.’” \n   \n","So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and the whole congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. \n","And Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.” \n   \n","Then Moses said to Aaron, “Approach the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering to make atonement for yourself and for the people. And sacrifice the people’s offering to make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded.” \n   \n","So Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself. \n","The sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and applied it to the horns of the altar. And he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. \n","On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the LORD had commanded Moses. \n","But he burned up the flesh and the hide outside the camp. \n   \n","Then Aaron slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar. \n","They brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar. \n","He washed the entrails and the legs and burned them atop the burnt offering on the altar. \n   \n","Aaron then presented the people’s offering. He took the male goat for the people’s sin offering, slaughtered it, and offered it for sin like the first one. \n   \n","He presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance. \n   \n","Next he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering. \n   \n","Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram as the people’s peace offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar. \n   \n","They also brought the fat portions from the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the fat covering the entrails, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver—\n","and placed these on the breasts. Aaron burned the fat portions on the altar, \n","but he waved the breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses had commanded. \n   \n","Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having made the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering, he stepped down. \n   \n","Moses and Aaron then entered the Tent of Meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people. \n","Fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown. \n"],["Now Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense, and offered unauthorized  fire before the LORD, contrary to His command. \n","So fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died in the presence of the LORD. \n   \n","Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD meant when He said: \n  ‘To those who come near Me \n I will show My holiness, \n and in the sight of all the people \n I will reveal My glory.’” \n  But Aaron remained silent. \n   \n","Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here; carry the bodies of your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary.” \n","So they came forward and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses had directed. \n   \n","Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your hair become disheveled  and do not tear your garments, or else you will die, and the LORD will be angry with the whole congregation. But your brothers, the whole house of Israel, may mourn on account of the fire that the LORD has ignited. \n","You shall not go outside the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, or you will die, for the LORD’s anointing oil is on you.” \n  So they did as Moses instructed. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Aaron, \n","“You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink when you enter the Tent of Meeting, or else you will die; this is a permanent statute for the generations to come. \n","You must distinguish between the holy and the common, between the clean and the unclean, \n","so that you may teach the Israelites all the statutes that the LORD has given them through Moses.” \n   \n","And Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering that remains from the offerings made by fire to the LORD and eat it without leaven beside the altar, because it is most holy. \n","You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your share and your sons’ share of the offerings made by fire to the LORD; for this is what I have been commanded. \n   \n","And you and your sons and daughters may eat the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution in a ceremonially clean place, because these portions have been assigned to you and your children from the peace offerings of the sons of Israel. \n","They are to bring the thigh of the contribution and the breast of the wave offering, together with the fat portions of the offerings made by fire, to wave as a wave offering before the LORD. It will belong permanently to you and your children, as the LORD has commanded.” \n   \n","Later, Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, and asked, \n","“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the holy place? For it is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the congregation by making atonement for them before the LORD. \n","Since its blood was not brought inside the holy place, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.” \n   \n","But Aaron replied to Moses, “Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. Since these things have happened to me, if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been acceptable in the sight of the LORD?” \n   \n","And when Moses heard this explanation, he was satisfied. \n"],["The LORD spoke again to Moses and Aaron, telling them, \n","“Say to the Israelites, ‘Of all the beasts of the earth, these ones you may eat: \n","You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud. \n   \n","But of those that only chew the cud or only have a divided hoof, you are not to eat the following: \n  The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you. \n   \n","The rock badger, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you. \n   \n","The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you. \n   \n","And the pig, though it has a split hoof completely divided, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. \n   \n","You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you. \n   \n","Of all the creatures that live in the water, whether in the seas or in the streams, you may eat anything with fins and scales. \n   \n","But the following among all the teeming life and creatures in the water are detestable to you: everything in the seas or streams that does not have fins and scales. \n","They shall be an abomination to you; you must not eat their meat, and you must detest their carcasses. \n","Everything in the water that does not have fins and scales shall be detestable to you. \n   \n","Additionally, you are to detest the following birds, and they must not be eaten because they are detestable: \n  the eagle, the bearded vulture, the black vulture, \n   \n","the kite, any kind of falcon, \n   \n","any kind of raven, \n   \n","the ostrich, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, \n   \n","the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, \n   \n","the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey, \n   \n","the stork, any kind of heron, \n  the hoopoe, and the bat. \n   \n","All flying insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you. \n","However, you may eat the following kinds of flying insects that walk on all fours: those having jointed legs above their feet for hopping on the ground. \n","Of these you may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket, or grasshopper. \n","All other flying insects that have four legs are detestable to you. \n   \n","These creatures will make you unclean.

He must not eat from the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water. \n   \n","When the sun has set, he will become clean, and then he may eat from the sacred offerings, for they are his food. \n","He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, which would make him unclean. I am the LORD. \n","The priests must keep My charge, lest they bear the guilt and die because they profane it.

For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and tell them, ‘Any man of the house of Israel or any foreign resident who presents a gift for a burnt offering to the LORD, whether to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering, \n","must offer an unblemished male from the cattle, sheep, or goats in order for it to be accepted on your behalf. \n","You must not present anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf. \n   \n","When a man presents a peace offering to the LORD from the herd or flock to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering, it must be without blemish or defect to be acceptable. \n","You are not to present to the LORD any animal that is blind, injured, or maimed, or anything with a running sore, a festering rash, or a scab; you must not put any of these on the altar as an offering made by fire to the LORD. \n   \n","You may present as a freewill offering an ox  or sheep that has a deformed or stunted limb, but it is not acceptable in fulfillment of a vow. \n","You are not to present to the LORD an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed, torn, or cut; you are not to sacrifice them in your land. \n","Neither you nor a foreigner shall present food to your God from any such animal.

You must not do any regular work. \n","For seven days you are to present an offering made by fire to the LORD.

Just as he injured the other person, the same must be inflicted on him. \n   \n","Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a man must be put to death. \n","You are to have the same standard of law for the foreign resident and the native; for I am the LORD your God.’” \n   \n","Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses. \n"],["Then the LORD said to Moses on Mount Sinai, \n","“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land that I am giving you, the land itself must observe a Sabbath to the LORD. \n   \n","For six years you may sow your field and prune your vineyard and gather its crops. \n","But in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of complete rest for the land—a Sabbath to the LORD. \n  You are not to sow your field or prune your vineyard. \n","You are not to reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or gather the grapes of your untended vines. The land must have a year of complete rest. \n","Whatever the land yields during the Sabbath year shall be food for you—for yourself, your manservant and maidservant, the hired hand or foreigner who stays with you, \n","and for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. All its growth may serve as food. \n   \n","And you shall count off seven Sabbaths of years—seven times seven years—so that the seven Sabbaths of years amount to forty-nine years. \n","Then you are to sound the horn far and wide on the tenth day of the seventh month, the Day of Atonement. You shall sound it throughout your land. \n   \n","So you are to consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty in the land for all its inhabitants. It shall be your Jubilee, when each of you is to return to his property and to his clan. \n   \n","The fiftieth year will be a Jubilee for you; you are not to sow the land or reap its aftergrowth or harvest the untended vines. \n","For it is a Jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You may eat only the crops taken directly from the field. \n   \n","In this Year of Jubilee, each of you shall return to his own property. \n   \n","If you make a sale to your neighbor or a purchase from him, you must not take advantage of each other. \n","You are to buy from your neighbor according to the number of years since the last Jubilee; he is to sell to you according to the number of harvest years remaining. \n","You shall increase the price in proportion to a greater number of years, or decrease it in proportion to a lesser number of years; for he is selling you a given number of harvests. \n   \n","Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God; for I am the LORD your God. \n   \n","You are to keep My statutes and carefully observe My judgments, so that you may dwell securely in the land. \n","Then the land will yield its fruit, so that you can eat your fill and dwell in safety in the land. \n   \n","Now you may wonder, ‘What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not sow or gather our produce?’ \n","But I will send My blessing upon you in the sixth year, so that the land will yield a crop sufficient for three years. \n","While you are sowing in the eighth year, you will be eating from the previous harvest, until the ninth year’s harvest comes in. \n   \n","The land must not be sold permanently, because it is Mine, and you are but foreigners and residents with Me. \n","Thus for every piece of property you possess, you must provide for the redemption of the land. \n   \n","If your brother becomes impoverished and sells some of his property, his nearest of kin may come and redeem what his brother has sold. \n","Or if a man has no one to redeem it for him, but he prospers and acquires enough to redeem his land, \n","he shall calculate the years since its sale, repay the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and return to his property. \n","But if he cannot obtain enough to repay him, what he sold will remain in possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. In the Jubilee, however, it is to be released, so that he may return to his property. \n   \n","If a man sells a house in a walled city, he retains his right of redemption until a full year after its sale; during that year it may be redeemed. \n","If it is not redeemed by the end of a full year, then the house in the walled city is permanently transferred to its buyer and his descendants. It is not to be released in the Jubilee. \n","But houses in villages with no walls around them are to be considered as open fields. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee. \n   \n","As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the cities they possess. \n","So whatever belongs to the Levites may be redeemed—a house sold in a city they possess—and must be released in the Jubilee, because the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the Israelites. \n","But the open pastureland around their cities may not be sold, for this is their permanent possession. \n   \n","Now if your countryman becomes destitute and cannot support himself among you, then you are to help him as you would a foreigner or stranger, so that he can continue to live among you. \n","Do not take any interest or profit from him, but fear your God, that your countryman may live among you. \n","You must not lend him your silver at interest or sell him your food for profit. \n","I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God. \n   \n","If a countryman among you becomes destitute and sells himself to you, then you must not force him into slave labor. \n","Let him stay with you as a hired worker or temporary resident; he is to work for you until the Year of Jubilee. \n","Then he and his children are to be released, and he may return to his clan and to the property of his fathers. \n   \n","Because the Israelites are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, they are not to be sold as slaves. \n","You are not to rule over them harshly, but you shall fear your God. \n   \n","Your menservants and maidservants shall come from the nations around you, from whom you may purchase them. \n","You may also purchase them from the foreigners residing among you or their clans living among you who are born in your land. These may become your property. \n","You may leave them to your sons after you to inherit as property; you can make them slaves for life. But as for your brothers, the Israelites, no man may rule harshly over his brother. \n   \n","If a foreigner residing among you prospers, but your countryman dwelling near him becomes destitute and sells himself to the foreigner or to a member of his clan, \n","he retains the right of redemption after he has sold himself. One of his brothers may redeem him: \n","either his uncle or cousin or any close relative from his clan may redeem him. Or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. \n   \n","He and his purchaser will then count the time from the year he sold himself up to the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale will be determined by the number of years, based on the daily wages of a hired hand. \n","If many years remain, he must pay for his redemption in proportion to his purchase price. \n","If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he is to calculate and pay his redemption according to his remaining years. \n","He shall be treated like a man hired from year to year, but a foreign owner must not rule over him harshly in your sight. \n   \n","Even if he is not redeemed in any of these ways, he and his children shall be released in the Year of Jubilee. \n","For the Israelites are My servants.

But if he does substitute one animal for another, both that animal and its substitute will be holy. \n   \n","But if the vow involves any of the unclean animals that may not be brought as an offering to the LORD, the animal must be presented before the priest. \n","The priest shall set its value, whether high or low; as the priest values it, the price will be set. \n","If, however, the owner decides to redeem the animal, he must add a fifth to its value. \n   \n","Now if a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, then the priest shall value it either as good or bad. The price will stand just as the priest values it. \n","But if he who consecrated his house redeems it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value, and it will belong to him. \n   \n","If a man consecrates to the LORD a parcel of his land, then your valuation shall be proportional to the seed required for it—fifty shekels of silver for every homer of barley seed. \n","If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the price will stand according to your valuation. \n   \n","But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, the priest is to calculate the price in proportion to the years left until the next Year of Jubilee, so that your valuation will be reduced. \n","And if the one who consecrated the field decides to redeem it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value, and it shall belong to him. \n   \n","If, however, he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold it to another man, it may no longer be redeemed. \n","When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field devoted to the LORD; it becomes the property of the priests. \n   \n","Now if a man consecrates to the LORD a field he has purchased, which is not a part of his own property, \n","then the priest shall calculate for him the value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the man shall pay the assessed value on that day as a sacred offering to the LORD. \n","In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought—the original owner of the land. \n","Every valuation will be according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel. \n   \n","But no one may consecrate a firstborn of the livestock, because a firstborn belongs to the LORD. Whether it is an ox or a sheep, it is the LORD’s. \n","But if it is among the unclean animals, then he may redeem it according to your valuation and add a fifth of its value. If it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation. \n   \n","Nothing that a man sets apart  to the LORD from all he owns—whether a man, an animal, or his inherited land—can be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD. \n   \n","No person set apart for destruction may be ransomed; he must surely be put to death. \n   \n","Thus any tithe from the land, whether from the seed of the land or the fruit of the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD. \n","If a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe, he must add a fifth to its value. \n   \n","Every tenth animal from the herd or flock that passes under the shepherd’s rod will be holy to the LORD. \n","He must not inspect whether it is good or bad, and he shall not make any substitution. But if he does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute shall become holy; they cannot be redeemed.’” \n   \n","These are the commandments that the LORD gave to Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai. "]],"Numbers":[["On the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt, the LORD spoke to Moses in the Tent of Meeting in the Wilderness of Sinai.

But the preceding days shall not be counted, because his separation was defiled. \n   \n","Now this is the law of the Nazirite when his time of separation is complete: He must be brought to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, \n","and he is to present an offering to the LORD of an unblemished year-old male lamb as a burnt offering, an unblemished year-old female lamb as a sin offering, and an unblemished ram as a peace offering—\n","together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—and a basket of unleavened cakes made from fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers coated with oil. \n   \n","The priest is to present all these before the LORD and make the sin offering and the burnt offering. \n","He shall also offer the ram as a peace offering to the LORD, along with the basket of unleavened bread. And the priest is to offer the accompanying grain offering and drink offering. \n   \n","Then at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the Nazirite is to shave his consecrated head, take the hair, and put it on the fire under the peace offering. \n","And the priest is to take the boiled shoulder from the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them into the hands of the Nazirite who has just shaved the hair of his consecration. \n","The priest shall then wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.

The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses. \n   \n","But there were some men who were unclean due to a dead body, so they could not observe the Passover on that day. And they came before Moses and Aaron that same day \n","and said to Moses, “We are unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be excluded from presenting the LORD’s offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?” \n   \n","“Wait here until I find out what the LORD commands concerning you,” Moses replied. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Tell the Israelites: ‘When any one of you or your descendants is unclean because of a dead body, or is away on a journey, he may still observe the Passover to the LORD. \n","Such people are to observe it at twilight on the fourteenth day of the second month. They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; \n","they may not leave any of it until morning or break any of its bones. They must observe the Passover according to all its statutes. \n   \n","But if a man who is ceremonially clean and is not on a journey still fails to observe the Passover, he must be cut off from his people, because he did not present the LORD’s offering at its appointed time. That man will bear the consequences of his sin. \n   \n","If a foreigner dwelling among you wants to observe the Passover to the LORD, he is to do so according to the Passover statute and its ordinances. You are to apply the same statute to both the foreigner and the native of the land.’” \n   \n","On the day that the tabernacle, the Tent of the Testimony, was set up, the cloud covered it and appeared like fire above the tabernacle from evening until morning. \n","It remained that way continually; the cloud would cover the tabernacle by day, and at night it would appear like fire. \n","Whenever the cloud was lifted from above the Tent, the Israelites would set out, and wherever the cloud settled, there the Israelites would camp. \n","At the LORD’s command the Israelites set out, and at the LORD’s command they camped. As long as the cloud remained over the tabernacle, they remained encamped. \n   \n","Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the Israelites kept the LORD’s charge and did not set out. \n","Sometimes the cloud remained over the tabernacle for only a few days, and they would camp at the LORD’s command and set out at the LORD’s command. \n","Sometimes the cloud remained only from evening until morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they would set out. Whether it was by day or by night, when the cloud was taken up, they would set out. \n   \n","Whether the cloud lingered for two days, a month, or longer, the Israelites camped and did not set out as long as the cloud remained over the tabernacle; but when it was lifted, they would set out. \n","They camped at the LORD’s command, and they set out at the LORD’s command; they carried out the LORD’s charge according to His command through Moses. \n"],["Then the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Make two trumpets of hammered silver to be used for calling the congregation and for having the camps set out. \n","When both are sounded, the whole congregation is to assemble before you at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. \n","But if only one is sounded, then the leaders, the heads of the clans of Israel, are to gather before you. \n   \n","When you sound short blasts, the camps that lie on the east side are to set out. \n","When you sound the short blasts a second time, the camps that lie on the south side are to set out. The blasts are to signal them to set out. \n","To convene the assembly, you are to sound long blasts, not short ones. \n","The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to sound the trumpets.

I am the LORD your God.” \n   \n","On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud was lifted from above the tabernacle of the Testimony, \n","and the Israelites set out from the Wilderness of Sinai, traveling from place to place until the cloud settled in the Wilderness of Paran. \n","They set out this first time according to the LORD’s command through Moses. \n   \n","First, the divisions of the camp of Judah set out under their standard, with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command. \n","Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar, \n","and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun. \n","Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and the Merarites set out, transporting it. \n   \n","Then the divisions of the camp of Reuben set out under their standard, with Elizur son of Shedeur in command. \n","Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon, \n","and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad. \n","Then the Kohathites set out, transporting the holy objects; the tabernacle was to be set up before their arrival. \n   \n","Next, the divisions of the camp of Ephraim set out under their standard, with Elishama son of Ammihud in command. \n","Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh, \n","and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin. \n   \n","Finally, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard, serving as the rear guard for all units, with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai in command. \n","Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher, \n","and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali. \n   \n","This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out. \n   \n","Then Moses said to Hobab, the son of Moses’ father-in-law Reuel  the Midianite, “We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said: ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.” \n   \n","“I will not go,” Hobab replied. “Instead, I am going back to my own land and my own people.” \n   \n","“Please do not leave us,” Moses said, “since you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our eyes. \n","If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us.” \n   \n","So they set out on a three-day journey from the mountain of the LORD, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD traveling ahead of them for those three days to seek a resting place for them. \n","And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp. \n   \n","Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, \n  “Rise up, O LORD! \n May Your enemies be scattered; \n may those who hate You flee before You.” \n   \n","And when it came to rest, he would say: \n  “Return, O LORD, \n to the countless thousands of Israel.” \n"],["Soon the people began to complain about their hardship in the hearing of the LORD, and when He heard them, His anger was kindled, and fire from the LORD blazed among them and consumed the outskirts of the camp. \n","And the people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down. \n","So that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD had burned among them. \n   \n","Meanwhile, the rabble among them had a strong craving for other food, and again the Israelites wept and said, “Who will feed us meat? \n","We remember the fish we ate freely in Egypt, along with the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic. \n","But now our appetite is gone; there is nothing to see but this manna!” \n   \n","Now the manna resembled coriander seed, and its appearance was like that of gum resin. \n","The people walked around and gathered it, ground it on a handmill or crushed it in a mortar, then boiled it in a cooking pot or shaped it into cakes. It tasted like pastry baked with fine oil. \n","When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it. \n   \n","Then Moses heard the people of family after family weeping at the entrances to their tents, and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly, and Moses was also displeased. \n   \n","So Moses asked the LORD, “Why have You brought this trouble on Your servant? Why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid upon me the burden of all these people? \n","Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth, so that You should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries an infant,’ to the land that You swore to give their fathers? \n   \n","Where can I get meat for all these people? For they keep crying out to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ \n   \n","I cannot carry all these people by myself; it is too burdensome for me. \n","If this is how You are going to treat me, please kill me right now—if I have found favor in Your eyes—and let me not see my own wretchedness.” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, “Bring Me seventy of the elders of Israel known to you as leaders and officers of the people. Bring them to the Tent of Meeting and have them stand there with you. \n   \n","And I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put that Spirit on them. They will help you bear the burden of the people, so that you do not have to bear it by yourself. \n   \n","And say to the people: Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you will eat meat, because you have cried out in the hearing of the LORD, saying: ‘Who will feed us meat? For we were better off in Egypt!’ Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat. \n","You will eat it not for one or two days, nor for five or ten or twenty days, \n","but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and makes you nauseous—because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have cried out before Him, saying, ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?’” \n   \n","But Moses replied, “Here I am among 600,000 men on foot, yet You say, ‘I will give them meat, and they will eat for a month.’ \n","If all our flocks and herds were slaughtered for them, would they have enough? Or if all the fish in the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?” \n   \n","The LORD answered Moses, “Is the LORD’s arm too short? Now you will see whether or not My word will come to pass.” \n   \n","So Moses went out and relayed to the people the words of the LORD, and he gathered seventy of the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent. \n","Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and He took some of the Spirit that was on Moses and placed that Spirit on the seventy elders. As the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but they never did so again. \n   \n","Two men, however, had remained in the camp—one named Eldad and the other Medad—and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those listed, but they had not gone out to the tent, and they prophesied in the camp. \n","A young man ran and reported to Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.” \n   \n","Joshua son of Nun, the attendant to Moses since youth, spoke up and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!” \n   \n","But Moses replied, “Are you jealous on my account? I wish that all the LORD’s people were prophets and that the LORD would place His Spirit on them!” \n   \n","Then Moses returned to the camp, along with the elders of Israel. \n   \n","Now a wind sent by the LORD came up, drove in quail from the sea, and brought them near the camp, about two cubits above the surface of the ground, for a day’s journey in every direction around the camp. \n","All that day and night, and all the next day, the people stayed up gathering the quail. No one gathered less than ten homers, and they spread them out all around the camp. \n   \n","But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and the LORD struck them with a severe plague. \n","So they called that place Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved other food. \n   \n","From Kibroth-hattaavah the people moved on to Hazeroth, where they remained for some time. \n"],["Then Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because of the Cushite woman he had married, for he had taken a Cushite wife. \n","“Does the LORD speak only through Moses?” they said. “Does He not also speak through us?” And the LORD heard this. \n   \n","Now Moses was a very humble man, more so than any man on the face of the earth. \n   \n","And suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “You three, come out to the Tent of Meeting.” So the three went out, \n","and the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, stood at the entrance to the Tent, and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them had stepped forward, \n","He said, “Hear now My words: \n  If there is a prophet among you, \n I, the LORD, will reveal Myself to him in a vision; \n I will speak to him in a dream. \n  \n","But this is not so with My servant Moses; \n he is faithful in all My house. \n  \n","I speak with him face to face, \n clearly and not in riddles; \n he sees the form of the LORD. \n  Why then were you unafraid to speak against My servant Moses?” \n","So the anger of the LORD burned against them, and He departed. \n   \n","As the cloud lifted from above the Tent, suddenly Miriam became leprous, white as snow. Aaron turned toward her, saw that she was leprous, \n","and said to Moses, “My lord, please do not hold against us this sin we have so foolishly committed. \n","Please do not let her be like a stillborn infant whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.” \n   \n","So Moses cried out to the LORD, “O God, please heal her!” \n   \n","But the LORD answered Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days; after that she may be brought back in.” \n   \n","So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought in again. \n","After that, the people set out from Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran. \n"],["And the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Send out for yourself men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each of their fathers’ tribes send one man who is a leader among them.” \n   \n","So at the consent  of the LORD, Moses sent them out from the Wilderness of Paran. All the men were leaders of the Israelites, \n","and these were their names: \n  From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur; \n   \n","from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; \n   \n","from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; \n   \n","from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; \n   \n","from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; \n   \n","from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; \n   \n","from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; \n   \n","from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi; \n   \n","from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; \n   \n","from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael; \n   \n","from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi; \n   \n","and from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi. \n   \n","These were the names of the men Moses sent to spy out the land; and Moses gave to Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua. \n   \n","When Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he told them, “Go up through the Negev and into the hill country. \n","See what the land is like and whether its people are strong or weak, few or many. \n","Is the land where they live good or bad? Are the cities where they dwell open camps or fortifications? \n","Is the soil fertile or unproductive? Are there trees in it or not? Be courageous, and bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) \n   \n","So they went up and spied out the land from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo-hamath. \n","They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, dwelled. It had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt. \n   \n","When they came to the Valley of Eshcol, they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which they carried on a pole between two men. They also took some pomegranates and figs. \n","Because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut there, that place was called the Valley of Eshcol. \n   \n","After forty days the men returned from spying out the land, \n","and they went back to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh. They brought back a report for the whole congregation and showed them the fruit of the land. \n   \n","And they gave this account to Moses: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and indeed, it is flowing with milk and honey. Here is some of its fruit! \n","Nevertheless, the people living in the land are strong, and the cities are large and fortified. We even saw the descendants of Anak there. \n","The Amalekites live in the land of the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the Jordan.” \n   \n","Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, “We must go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly conquer it!” \n   \n","But the men who had gone up with him replied, “We cannot go up against the people, for they are stronger than we are!” \n   \n","So they gave the Israelites a bad report about the land that they had spied out: “The land we explored devours its inhabitants, and all the people we saw there are great in stature. \n","We even saw the Nephilim there—the descendants of Anak that come from the Nephilim! We seemed like grasshoppers in our own sight, and we must have seemed the same to them!” \n"],["Then the whole congregation lifted up their voices and cried out, and that night the people wept. \n","All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness! \n","Why is the LORD bringing us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will become plunder. Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?” \n   \n","So they said to one another, “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt.” \n   \n","Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown before the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel. \n   \n","Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes \n","and said to the whole congregation of Israel, “The land we passed through and explored is an exceedingly good land. \n","If the LORD delights in us, He will bring us into this land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and He will give it to us. \n","Only do not rebel against the LORD, and do not be afraid of the people of the land, for they will be like bread for us. Their protection has been removed, and the LORD is with us. Do not be afraid of them!” \n   \n","But the whole congregation threatened to stone Joshua and Caleb. \n  Then the glory of the LORD appeared to all the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting. \n","And the LORD said to Moses, “How long will this people treat Me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in Me, despite all the signs I have performed among them? \n","I will strike them with a plague and destroy them—and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are.” \n   \n","But Moses said to the LORD, “The Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your strength You brought this people from among them. \n","And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have already heard that You, O LORD, are in the midst of this people, that You, O LORD, have been seen face to face, that Your cloud stands over them, and that You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. \n   \n","If You kill this people as one man, the nations who have heard of Your fame will say, \n","‘Because the LORD was unable to bring this people into the land He swore to give them, He has slaughtered them in the wilderness.’ \n   \n","So now I pray, may the power of my Lord be magnified, just as You have declared: \n","‘The LORD is slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion, forgiving iniquity and transgression. Yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished; He will visit the iniquity of the fathers upon their children to the third and fourth generation.’ \n   \n","Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people, in keeping with the greatness of Your loving devotion, just as You have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.” \n   \n","“I have pardoned them as you requested,” the LORD replied. \n","“Yet as surely as I live and as surely as the whole earth is filled with the glory of the LORD, \n","not one of the men who have seen My glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness—yet have tested Me and disobeyed Me these ten times—\n","not one will ever see the land that I swore to give their fathers. None of those who have treated Me with contempt will see it. \n   \n","But because My servant Caleb has a different spirit and has followed Me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he has entered, and his descendants will inherit it. \n   \n","Now since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and head for the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea. ” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, \n","“How long will this wicked congregation grumble against Me? I have heard the complaints that the Israelites are making against Me. \n","So tell them: As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you exactly as I heard you say. \n","Your bodies will fall in this wilderness—all who were numbered in the census, everyone twenty years of age or older—because you have grumbled against Me. \n   \n","Surely none of you will enter the land in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. \n","But I will bring your children, whom you said would become plunder, into the land you have rejected—and they will enjoy it. \n","As for you, however, your bodies will fall in this wilderness. \n   \n","Your children will be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years, and they will suffer for your unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness. \n","In keeping with the forty days you spied out the land, you shall bear your guilt forty years—a year for each day—and you will experience My alienation. \n   \n","I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this entire wicked congregation, which has conspired against Me. They will meet their end in the wilderness, and there they will die.” \n   \n","So the men Moses had sent to spy out the land, who had returned and made the whole congregation grumble against him by bringing out a bad report about the land—\n","those men who had brought out the bad report about the land—were struck down by a plague before the LORD. \n","Of those men who had gone to spy out the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh remained alive. \n   \n","And when Moses relayed these words to all the Israelites, the people mourned bitterly. \n   \n","Early the next morning they got up and went up toward the ridge of the hill country. “We have indeed sinned,” they said, “but we will go to the place the LORD has promised.” \n   \n","But Moses said, “Why are you transgressing the commandment of the LORD? This will not succeed! \n","Do not go up, lest you be struck down by your enemies, because the LORD is not among you. \n","For there the Amalekites and Canaanites will face you, and you will fall by the sword. Because you have turned away from the LORD, He will not be with you.” \n   \n","But they dared to go up to the ridge of the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the covenant of the LORD moved from the camp. \n","Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that part of the hill country came down, attacked them, and routed them all the way to Hormah. \n"],["Then the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: After you enter the land that I am giving you as a home \n","and you present an offering made by fire to the LORD from the herd or flock to produce a pleasing aroma to the LORD—either a burnt offering or a sacrifice, for a special vow or freewill offering or appointed feast—\n","then the one presenting his offering to the LORD shall also present a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour   mixed with a quarter hin of olive oil. \n","With the burnt offering or sacrifice of each lamb, you are to prepare a quarter hin of wine as a drink offering. \n   \n","With a ram you are to prepare a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah   of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of olive oil, \n","and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. \n   \n","When you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice to fulfill a vow or as a peace offering to the LORD, \n","present with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour   mixed with half a hin of olive oil. \n","Also present half a hin of wine as a drink offering. It is an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. \n","This is to be done for each bull, ram, lamb, or goat. \n","This is how you must prepare each one, no matter how many. \n   \n","Everyone who is native-born shall prepare these things in this way when he presents an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. \n","And for the generations to come, if a foreigner residing with you or someone else among you wants to prepare an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, he is to do exactly as you do. \n","The assembly is to have the same statute both for you and for the foreign resident; it is a permanent statute for the generations to come. You and the foreigner shall be the same before the LORD. \n","The same law and the same ordinance will apply both to you and to the foreigner residing with you.” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land to which I am bringing you \n","and you eat the food of the land, you shall lift up an offering to the LORD. \n","From the first of your dough, you are to lift up a cake as a contribution; offer it just like an offering from the threshing floor. \n","Throughout your generations, you are to give the LORD an offering from the first of your dough. \n   \n","Now if you stray unintentionally and do not obey all these commandments that the LORD has spoken to Moses—\n","all that the LORD has commanded you through Moses from the day the LORD gave them and continuing through the generations to come—\n","and if it was done unintentionally without the knowledge of the congregation, then the whole congregation is to prepare one young bull as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and drink offering according to the regulation, and one male goat as a sin offering. \n   \n","The priest is to make atonement for the whole congregation of Israel, so that they may be forgiven; for the sin was unintentional and they have brought to the LORD an offering made by fire and a sin offering, presented before the LORD for their unintentional sin. \n","Then the whole congregation of Israel and the foreigners residing among them will be forgiven, since it happened to all the people unintentionally. \n   \n","Also, if one person sins unintentionally, he is to present a year-old female goat as a sin offering. \n","And the priest shall make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the person who erred by sinning unintentionally; and when atonement has been made for him, he will be forgiven. \n","You shall have the same law for the one who acts in error, whether he is a native-born Israelite or a foreigner residing among you. \n   \n","But the person who sins defiantly, whether a native or foreigner, blasphemes the LORD. That person shall be cut off from among his people. \n","He shall certainly be cut off, because he has despised the word of the LORD and broken His commandment; his guilt remains on him.” \n   \n","While the Israelites were in the wilderness, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day. \n","Those who found the man gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation, \n","and because it had not been declared what should be done to him, they placed him in custody. \n   \n","And the LORD said to Moses, “The man must surely be put to death. The whole congregation is to stone him outside the camp.” \n   \n","So the whole congregation took the man outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD had commanded Moses. \n   \n","Later, the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Speak to the Israelites and tell them that throughout the generations to come they are to make for themselves tassels for the corners of their garments, with a blue cord on each tassel. \n","These will serve as tassels for you to look at, so that you may remember all the commandments of the LORD, that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by following your own heart and your own eyes. \n   \n","Then you will remember and obey all My commandments, and you will be holy to your God. \n","I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD your God.” \n"],["Now Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath son of Levi, along with some Reubenites—Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—conducted \n","a rebellion against Moses, along with 250 men of Israel renowned as leaders of the congregation and representatives in the assembly. \n","They came together against Moses and Aaron and told them, “You have taken too much upon yourselves! For everyone in the entire congregation is holy, and the LORD is in their midst. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?” \n   \n","When Moses heard this, he fell facedown. \n","Then he said to Korah and all his followers, “Tomorrow morning the LORD will reveal who belongs to Him  and who is holy, and He will bring that person near to Himself. The one He chooses, He will bring near to Himself. \n","You, Korah, and all your followers are to do as follows: Take censers, \n","and tomorrow you are to place fire and incense in them in the presence of the LORD. Then the man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy. It is you sons of Levi who have taken too much upon yourselves!” \n   \n","Moses also said to Korah, “Now listen, you sons of Levi! \n","Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel and brought you near to Himself to perform the work at the LORD’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them? \n","He has brought you near, you and all your fellow Levites, but you are seeking the priesthood as well. \n","Therefore, it is you and all your followers who have conspired against the LORD! As for Aaron, who is he that you should grumble against him?” \n   \n","Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come! \n","Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? Must you also appoint yourself as ruler over us? \n","Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!” \n   \n","Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, “Do not regard their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them or mistreated a single one of them.” \n   \n","And Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow—you and they and Aaron. \n","Each man is to take his censer, place incense in it, and present it before the LORD—250 censers. You and Aaron are to present your censers as well.” \n   \n","So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. \n","When Korah had gathered his whole assembly against them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the whole congregation. \n   \n","And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, \n","“Separate yourselves from this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant.” \n   \n","But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man sins, will You be angry with the whole congregation?” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Tell the congregation to move away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.” \n   \n","So Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. \n","And he warned the congregation, “Move away now from the tents of these wicked men. Do not touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.” \n   \n","So they moved away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram had come out and stood at the entrances to their tents with their wives and children and infants. \n   \n","Then Moses said, “This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things, for it was not my own doing: \n","If these men die a natural death, or if they suffer the fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me. \n","But if the LORD brings about something unprecedented, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them and all that belongs to them so that they go down alive into Sheol, then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt.” \n   \n","As soon as Moses had finished saying all this, the ground beneath them split open, \n","and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households—all Korah’s men and all their possessions. \n","They went down alive into Sheol with all they owned. The earth closed over them, and they vanished from the assembly. \n   \n","At their cries, all the people of Israel who were around them fled, saying, “The earth may swallow us too!” \n","And fire came forth from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to remove the censers from the flames and to scatter the coals far away, because the censers are holy. \n","As for the censers of those who sinned at the cost of their own lives, hammer them into sheets to overlay the altar, for these were presented before the LORD, and so have become holy. They will serve as a sign to the Israelites.” \n   \n","So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar, \n","just as the LORD commanded him through Moses. This was to be a reminder to the Israelites that no outsider who is not a descendant of Aaron should approach to offer incense before the LORD, lest he become like Korah and his followers. \n   \n","The next day the whole congregation of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the LORD’s people!” \n","But when the congregation gathered against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the Tent of Meeting, and suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared. \n   \n","Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting, \n","and the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Get away from this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant.” And Moses and Aaron fell facedown. \n   \n","Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, place fire from the altar in it, and add incense. Go quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, because wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has begun.” \n   \n","So Aaron took the censer as Moses had ordered and ran into the midst of the assembly. And seeing that the plague had begun among the people, he offered the incense and made atonement for the people. \n","He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague was halted. \n","But those who died from the plague numbered 14,700, in addition to those who had died on account of Korah. \n   \n","Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, since the plague had been halted. \n"],["And the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Speak to the Israelites and take from them twelve staffs, one from the leader of each tribe. Write each man’s name on his staff, \n","and write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi, because there must be one staff for the head of each tribe. \n","Place the staffs in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony, where I meet with you. \n","The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid Myself of the constant grumbling of the Israelites against you.” \n   \n","So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a staff—one for each of the leaders of their tribes, twelve staffs in all. And Aaron’s staff was among them. \n","Then Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the Tent of the Testimony. \n   \n","The next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, put forth buds, blossomed, and produced almonds. \n","Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD’s presence to all the Israelites. They saw them, and each man took his own staff. \n   \n","The LORD said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the Testimony, to be kept as a sign for the rebellious, so that you may put an end to their grumbling against Me, lest they die.” \n","So Moses did as the LORD had commanded him. \n   \n","Then the Israelites declared to Moses, “Look, we are perishing! We are lost; we are all lost! \n","Anyone who comes near the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all going to perish?” \n"],["So the LORD said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your father’s house must bear the iniquity involving the sanctuary. And you and your sons alone must bear the iniquity involving your priesthood. \n","But bring with you also your brothers from the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may join you and assist you and your sons before the Tent of the Testimony. \n","And they shall attend to your duties and to all the duties of the Tent; but they must not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar, or both they and you will die. \n","They are to join you and attend to the duties of the Tent of Meeting, doing all the work at the Tent; but no outsider may come near you. \n   \n","And you shall attend to the duties of the sanctuary and of the altar, so that wrath may not fall on the Israelites again. \n","Behold, I Myself have selected your fellow Levites from the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD to perform the service for the Tent of Meeting. \n","But only you and your sons shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and what is inside the veil, and you are to perform that service. I am giving you the work of the priesthood as a gift, but any outsider who comes near the sanctuary must be put to death.” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Aaron, “Behold, I have put you in charge of My offerings. As for all the sacred offerings of the Israelites, I have given them to you and your sons as a portion and a permanent statute. \n","A portion of the most holy offerings reserved from the fire will be yours. From all the offerings they render to Me as most holy offerings, whether grain offerings or sin offerings or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons. \n","You are to eat it as a most holy offering, and every male may eat it. You shall regard it as holy. \n   \n","And this is yours as well: the offering of their gifts, along with all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I have given this to you and your sons and daughters as a permanent statute. Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat it. \n","I give you all the freshest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain that the Israelites give to the LORD as their firstfruits. \n","The firstfruits of everything in their land that they bring to the LORD will belong to you. Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat them. \n   \n","Every devoted thing in Israel belongs to you. \n","The firstborn of every womb, whether man or beast, that is offered to the LORD belongs to you. But you must surely redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals. \n","You are to pay the redemption price for a month-old male according to your valuation: five shekels of silver,  according to the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty gerahs. \n   \n","But you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox, a sheep, or a goat; they are holy. You are to sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. \n","And their meat belongs to you, just as the breast and right thigh of the wave offering belong to you. \n   \n","All the holy offerings that the Israelites present to the LORD I give to you and to your sons and daughters as a permanent statute. It is a permanent covenant of salt  before the LORD for you and your offspring.” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites. \n   \n","Behold, I have given to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as an inheritance in return for the work they do, the service of the Tent of Meeting. \n","No longer may the Israelites come near to the Tent of Meeting, or they will incur guilt and die. \n   \n","The Levites are to perform the work of the Tent of Meeting, and they must bear their iniquity.

Its hide, its flesh, and its blood are to be burned, along with its dung. \n","The priest is to take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer. \n   \n","Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; after that he may enter the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean until evening. \n","The one who burned the heifer must also wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he too will be ceremonially unclean until evening. \n   \n","Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to gather up the ashes of the heifer and store them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They must be kept by the congregation of Israel for preparing the water of purification; this is for purification from sin. \n","The man who has gathered up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he will be ceremonially unclean until evening. This is a permanent statute for the Israelites and for the foreigner residing among them. \n   \n","Whoever touches any dead body will be unclean for seven days. \n","He must purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days, he will not be clean. \n","Anyone who touches a human corpse and fails to purify himself defiles the tabernacle of the LORD. That person must be cut off from Israel. He remains unclean, because the water of purification has not been sprinkled on him, and his uncleanness is still on him. \n   \n","This is the law when a person dies in a tent: Everyone who enters the tent and everyone already in the tent will be unclean for seven days, \n","and any open container without a lid fastened on it is unclean. \n   \n","Anyone in the open field who touches someone who has been killed by the sword or has died of natural causes, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days. \n   \n","For the purification of the unclean person, take some of the ashes of the burnt sin offering, put them in a jar, and pour fresh water  over them. \n","Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle the tent, all the furnishings, and the people who were there.

There Miriam died and was buried. \n   \n","Now there was no water for the congregation, so they gathered against Moses and Aaron. \n","The people quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had perished with our brothers before the LORD! \n","Why have you brought the LORD’s assembly into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here? \n","Why have you led us up out of Egypt to bring us to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain, figs, vines, or pomegranates—and there is no water to drink!” \n   \n","Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. They fell facedown, and the glory of the LORD appeared to them. \n","And the LORD said to Moses, \n","“Take the staff and assemble the congregation. You and your brother Aaron are to speak to the rock while they watch, and it will pour out its water. You will bring out water from the rock and provide drink for the congregation and their livestock.” \n   \n","So Moses took the staff from the LORD’s presence, just as he had been commanded. \n","Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock, and Moses said to them, “Listen now, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?” \n","Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff, so that a great amount of water gushed out, and the congregation and their livestock were able to drink. \n   \n","But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust Me to show My holiness in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.” \n   \n","These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD, and He showed His holiness among them. \n   \n","From Kadesh, Moses sent messengers to tell the king of Edom, “This is what your brother Israel says: You know all the hardship that has befallen us, \n","how our fathers went down to Egypt, where we lived many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers, \n","and when we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice, sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt. \n  Now look, we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory. \n","Please let us pass through your land. We will not cut through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well.

There will be no problem; only let us pass through on foot.” \n   \n","But Edom insisted, “You may not pass through.” And they came out to confront the Israelites with a large army and a strong hand. \n","So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through their territory, and Israel turned away from them. \n   \n","After they had set out from Kadesh, the whole congregation of Israel came to Mount Hor. \n","And at Mount Hor, near the border of the land of Edom, the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, \n","“Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will not enter the land that I have given the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah. \n","Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor. \n","Remove Aaron’s priestly garments and put them on his son Eleazar.

Israel devoted them and their cities to destruction; so they named the place Hormah. \n   \n","Then they set out from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, in order to bypass the land of Edom. But the people grew impatient on the journey \n","and spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you led us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread or water, and we detest this wretched food!” \n   \n","So the LORD sent venomous snakes among the people, and many of the Israelites were bitten and died. \n   \n","Then the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you. Intercede with the LORD so He will take the snakes away from us.” So Moses interceded for the people. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and mount it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks at it, he will live.” \n","So Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it on a pole. If anyone who was bitten looked at the bronze snake, he would live. \n   \n","Then the Israelites set out and camped at Oboth. \n","They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim in the wilderness opposite Moab to the east. \n","From there they set out and camped in the Valley of Zered. \n","From there they moved on and camped on the other side of the Arnon, in the wilderness that extends into the Amorite territory. \n  Now the Arnon is the border between the Moabites and the Amorites. \n","Therefore it is stated in the Book of the Wars of the LORD: \n  “Waheb in Suphah \n and the wadis of the Arnon, \n  \n","even the slopes of the wadis \n that extend to the site of Ar \n and lie along the border of Moab.” \n   \n","From there they went on to Beer, the well where the LORD said to Moses, “Gather the people so that I may give them water.” \n","Then Israel sang this song: \n  “Spring up, O well, \n all of you sing to it! \n  \n","The princes dug the well; \n the nobles of the people hollowed it out \n with their scepters \n and with their staffs.” \n  From the wilderness the Israelites went on to Mattanah, \n","and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, \n","and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland. \n   \n","Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, \n","“Let us pass through your land. We will not cut through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will stay on the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.” \n   \n","But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Instead, he gathered his whole army and went out to confront Israel in the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel. \n","And Israel put him to the sword and took possession of his land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok—but only up to the border of the Ammonites, because it was fortified. \n   \n","Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its villages. \n","Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land as far as the Arnon. \n","That is why the poets say: \n  “Come to Heshbon, let it be rebuilt; \n let the city of Sihon be restored. \n  \n","For a fire went out from Heshbon, \n a blaze from the city of Sihon. \n It consumed Ar of Moab, \n the rulers of Arnon’s heights. \n  \n","Woe to you, O Moab! \n You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh! \n He gave up his sons as refugees, \n and his daughters into captivity \n to Sihon king of the Amorites. \n  \n","But we have overthrown them; \n Heshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon. \n We demolished them as far as Nophah, \n which reaches to Medeba. ” \n   \n","So Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. \n","After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, Israel captured its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there. \n   \n","Then they turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army came out to meet them in battle at Edrei. \n   \n","But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, along with all his people and his land.

Indeed, Moab dreaded the Israelites. \n","So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will devour everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” \n  Since Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time, \n","he sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the Euphrates  in the land of his people. \n  “Behold, a people has come out of Egypt,” said Balak. “They cover the face of the land and have settled next to me. \n","So please come now and put a curse on this people, because they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land; for I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed.” \n   \n","The elders of Moab and Midian departed with the fees for divination in hand. They came to Balaam and relayed to him the words of Balak. \n   \n","“Spend the night here,” Balaam replied, “and I will give you the answer that the LORD speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. \n   \n","Then God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?” \n   \n","And Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message: \n","‘Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the face of the land.

You are not to curse this people, for they are blessed.” \n   \n","So Balaam got up the next morning and said to Balak’s princes, “Go back to your homeland, because the LORD has refused to let me go with you.” \n   \n","And the princes of Moab arose, returned to Balak, and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.” \n   \n","Then Balak sent other princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first messengers. \n","They came to Balaam and said, “This is what Balak son of Zippor says: ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me, \n","for I will honor you richly and do whatever you say. So please come and put a curse on this people for me!’” \n   \n","But Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything small or great to go beyond the command of the LORD my God. \n","So now, please stay here overnight as the others did, that I may find out what else the LORD has to tell me.” \n   \n","That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to summon you, get up and go with them, but you must only do what I tell you.” \n","So in the morning Balaam got up, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab. \n   \n","Then God’s anger was kindled because Balaam was going along, and the angel  of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him. \n   \n","When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, she turned off the path and went into a field.

So he beat her once again. \n   \n","And the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn to the right or left. \n","When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, and he became furious and beat her with his staff. \n   \n","Then the LORD opened the donkey’s mouth, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?” \n   \n","Balaam answered the donkey, “You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!” \n   \n","But the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not the donkey you have ridden all your life until today? Have I ever treated you this way before?” \n  “No,” he replied. \n   \n","Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand. And Balaam bowed low and fell facedown. \n   \n","The angel of the LORD asked him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you, because your way is perverse  before me. \n","The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, then by now I would surely have killed you and let her live.” \n   \n","“I have sinned,” Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, “for I did not realize that you were standing in the road to confront me. And now, if this is displeasing in your sight, I will go back home.” \n   \n","But the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you are to speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. \n   \n","When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite city on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory. \n","And he said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons?

I must speak only the word that God puts in my mouth.” \n   \n","So Balaam accompanied Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. \n","Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and he gave portions to Balaam and the princes who were with him. \n   \n","The next morning, Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal.

And this land will belong to you as a possession before the LORD. \n","But if you do not do this, you will certainly sin against the LORD—and be assured that your sin will find you out. \n","Build cities for your little ones and folds for your flocks, but do what you have promised.” \n   \n","The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “Your servants will do just as our lord commands. \n","Our children, our wives, our livestock, and all our animals will remain here in the cities of Gilead. \n","But your servants are equipped for war, and every man will cross over to the battle before the LORD, just as our lord says.” \n   \n","So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the family leaders of the tribes of Israel. \n","And Moses said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan with you, with every man armed for battle before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you are to give them the land of Gilead as a possession. \n","But if they do not arm themselves and go across with you, then they must accept their possession among you in the land of Canaan.” \n   \n","The Gadites and Reubenites replied, “As the LORD has spoken to your servants, so we will do. \n","We will cross over into the land of Canaan armed before the LORD, that we may have our inheritance on this side of the Jordan.” \n   \n","So Moses gave to the Gadites, to the Reubenites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the land including its cities and the territory surrounding them. \n   \n","And the Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, \n","Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, \n","Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and they built folds for their flocks. \n   \n","The Reubenites built up Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, \n","as well as Nebo and Baal-meon (whose names were changed), and Sibmah. And they renamed the cities they rebuilt. \n   \n","The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were there. \n","So Moses gave Gilead to the clan of Machir son of Manasseh, and they settled there. \n","Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured their villages and called them Havvoth-jair. \n","And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah, after his own name. \n"],["These are the journeys of the Israelites when they came out of the land of Egypt by their divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. \n","At the LORD’s command, Moses recorded the stages of their journey.

When the avenger of blood finds the murderer, he is to kill him. \n   \n","But if anyone pushes a person suddenly, without hostility, or throws an object at him unintentionally, \n","or without looking drops a heavy stone that kills him, but he was not an enemy and did not intend to harm him, \n","then the congregation must judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances. \n","The assembly is to protect the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood. Then the assembly will return him to the city of refuge to which he fled, and he must live there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil. \n   \n","But if the manslayer ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge to which he fled \n","and the avenger of blood finds him outside of his city of refuge and kills him, then the avenger will not be guilty of bloodshed \n","because the manslayer must remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. Only after the death of the high priest may he return to the land he owns. \n","This will be a statutory ordinance for you for the generations to come, wherever you live. \n   \n","If anyone kills a person, the murderer is to be put to death on the testimony of the witnesses. But no one is to be put to death based on the testimony of a lone witness. \n   \n","You are not to accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who deserves to die; he must surely be put to death. \n","Nor should you accept a ransom for the person who flees to a city of refuge and allow him to return and live on his own land before the death of the high priest. \n   \n","Do not pollute the land where you live, for bloodshed pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land on which the blood is shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it. \n","Do not defile the land where you live and where I dwell.

Enter and possess the land that the LORD swore He would give to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants after them.” \n   \n","At that time I said to you, “I cannot carry the burden for you alone. \n","The LORD your God has multiplied you, so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky. \n","May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times over and bless you as He has promised. \n","But how can I bear your troubles, burdens, and disputes all by myself? \n","Choose for yourselves wise, understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.” \n   \n","And you answered me and said, “What you propose to do is good.” \n   \n","So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them as leaders over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens, and as officers for your tribes. \n   \n","At that time I charged your judges: “Hear the disputes between your brothers, and judge fairly between a man and his brother or a foreign resident. \n","Show no partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be intimidated by anyone, for judgment belongs to God. And bring to me any case too difficult for you, and I will hear it.” \n   \n","And at that time I commanded you all the things you were to do. \n   \n","And just as the LORD our God had commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites, through all the vast and terrifying wilderness you have seen.

We struck them down until no survivor was left. \n   \n","At that time we captured all sixty of his cities. There was not a single city we failed to take—the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. \n","All these cities were fortified with high walls and gates and bars, and there were many more unwalled villages. \n","We devoted them to destruction, as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city. \n   \n","But all the livestock and plunder of the cities we carried off for ourselves. \n   \n","At that time we took from the two kings of the Amorites the land across the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Hermon—\n","which the Sidonians call Sirion but the Amorites call Senir—\n","all the cities of the plateau, all of Gilead, and all of Bashan as far as the cities of Salecah and Edrei in the kingdom of Og. \n   \n","(For only Og king of Bashan had remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. His bed of iron, nine cubits long and four cubits wide, is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.) \n   \n","So at that time we took possession of this land. To the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the land beyond Aroer along the Arnon Valley, and half the hill country of Gilead, along with its cities. \n   \n","To the half-tribe of Manasseh I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og. (The entire region of Argob, the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the land of the Rephaim.) \n","Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. He renamed Bashan after himself, Havvoth-jair, by which it is called to this day. \n   \n","To Machir I gave Gilead, \n","and to the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead to the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley was the border) and up to the Jabbok River, the border of the Ammonites. \n","The Jordan River in the Arabah bordered it from Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea  ) with the slopes of Pisgah to the east. \n   \n","At that time I commanded you: “The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of valor are to cross over, armed for battle, ahead of your brothers, the Israelites. \n","But your wives, your children, and your livestock—I know that you have much livestock—may remain in the cities I have given you, \n","until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as He has to you, and they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them across the Jordan. Then each of you may return to the possession I have given you.” \n   \n","And at that time I commanded Joshua: “Your own eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter. \n","Do not be afraid of them, for the LORD your God Himself will fight for you.” \n   \n","At that time I also pleaded with the LORD: \n","“O Lord GOD, You have begun to show Your greatness and power to Your servant. For what god in heaven or on earth can perform such works and mighty acts as Yours? \n","Please let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that pleasant hill country as well as Lebanon!” \n   \n","But the LORD was angry with me on account of you, and He would not listen to me. “That is enough,” the LORD said to me. “Do not speak to Me again about this matter. \n","Go to the top of Pisgah and look to the west and north and south and east. See the land with your own eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan. \n","But commission Joshua, encourage him, and strengthen him, for he will cross over ahead of the people and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.” \n   \n","So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth-peor. \n"],["Hear now, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances I am teaching you to follow, so that you may live and may enter and take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you. \n","You must not add to or subtract from what I command you, so that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I am giving you. \n   \n","Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor, for the LORD your God destroyed from among you all who followed Baal of Peor. \n","But you who held fast to the LORD your God are alive to this day, every one of you. \n   \n","See, I have taught you statutes and ordinances just as the LORD my God has commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land that you are about to enter and possess. \n","Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding in the sight of the peoples, who will hear of all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.” \n   \n","For what nation is great enough to have a god as near to them as the LORD our God is to us whenever we call on Him? \n","And what nation is great enough to have righteous statutes and ordinances like this entire law I set before you today? \n   \n","Only be on your guard and diligently watch yourselves, so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen, and so that they do not slip from your heart as long as you live.

You heard the sound of the words, but saw no form; there was only a voice. \n","He declared to you His covenant, which He commanded you to follow—the Ten Commandments  that He wrote on two tablets of stone. \n   \n","At that time the LORD commanded me to teach you the statutes and ordinances you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. \n   \n","So since you saw no form of any kind on the day the LORD spoke to you out of the fire at Horeb, be careful \n","that you do not act corruptly and make an idol for yourselves of any form or shape, whether in the likeness of a male or female, \n","of any beast that is on the earth or bird that flies in the air, \n","or of any creature that crawls on the ground or fish that is in the waters below. \n   \n","When you look to the heavens and see the sun and moon and stars—all the host of heaven—do not be enticed to bow down and worship what the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven. \n","Yet the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of His inheritance, as you are today. \n   \n","The LORD, however, was angry with me on account of you, and He swore that I would not cross the Jordan to enter the good land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance. \n","For I will not be crossing the Jordan, because I must die in this land. But you shall cross over and take possession of that good land. \n   \n","Be careful that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God that He made with you; do not make an idol for yourselves in the form of anything He has forbidden you. \n","For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. \n   \n","After you have children and grandchildren and you have been in the land a long time, if you then act corruptly and make an idol of any form—doing evil in the sight of the LORD your God and provoking Him to anger—\n","I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live long upon it, but will be utterly destroyed. \n   \n","Then the LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive you. \n","And there you will serve man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell. \n   \n","But if from there you will seek the LORD your God, you will find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul. \n","When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice. \n","For the LORD your God is a merciful God; He will not abandon you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers, which He swore to them by oath. \n   \n","Indeed, ask now from one end of the heavens to the other about the days that long preceded you, from the day that God created man on earth: Has anything as great as this ever happened or been reported? \n","Has a people ever heard the voice of God  speaking out of the fire, as you have, and lived? \n","Or has any god tried to take as his own a nation out of another nation—by trials, signs, wonders, and war, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors—as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt, before your eyes? \n   \n","You were shown these things so that you would know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides Him. \n   \n","He let you hear His voice from heaven to discipline you, and on earth He showed you His great fire, and you heard His words out of the fire. \n","Because He loved your fathers, He chose their descendants after them and brought you out of Egypt by His presence and great power, \n","to drive out before you nations greater and mightier than you, and to bring you into their land and give it to you for your inheritance, as it is this day. \n   \n","Know therefore this day and take to heart that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other. \n","Keep His statutes and commandments, which I am giving you today, so that you and your children after you may prosper, and that you may live long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for all time. \n   \n","Then Moses set aside three cities across the Jordan to the east \n","to which a manslayer could flee after killing his neighbor unintentionally without prior malice. \n  To save one’s own life, he could flee to one of these cities: \n","Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau belonging to the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead belonging to the Gadites, or Golan in Bashan belonging to the Manassites. \n   \n","This is the law that Moses set before the Israelites. \n","These are the testimonies, statutes, and ordinances that Moses proclaimed to them after they had come out of Egypt, \n","while they were in the valley across the Jordan facing Beth-peor in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites after they had come out of Egypt. \n   \n","They took possession of the land belonging to Sihon and to Og king of Bashan—the two Amorite kings across the Jordan to the east—\n","extending from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Siyon  (that is, Hermon), \n","including all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan and as far as the Sea of the Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah. \n"],["Then Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: \n  Hear, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances that I declare in your hearing this day.

They went as far as the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over. \n   \n","After three days the officers went through the camp \n","and commanded the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the Levitical priests, you are to set out from your positions and follow it. \n","But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits  between yourselves and the ark. Do not go near it, so that you can see the way to go, since you have never traveled this way before.” \n   \n","Then Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.” \n","And he said to the priests, “Take the ark of the covenant and go on ahead of the people.” So they carried the ark of the covenant and went ahead of them. \n   \n","Now the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you just as I was with Moses. \n","Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the waters, stand in the Jordan.’” \n   \n","So Joshua told the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.” \n","He continued, “This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that He will surely drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites. \n","Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go ahead of you into the Jordan. \n   \n","Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. \n","When the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD—the Lord of all the earth—touch down in the waters of the Jordan, its flowing waters will be cut off and will stand up in a heap.” \n   \n","So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of them. \n   \n","Now the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest season.

It backed up as far upstream as Adam, a city in the area of Zarethan, while the water flowing toward the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea  ) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho. \n","The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel crossed over the dry ground, until the entire nation had crossed the Jordan. \n"],["When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua, \n","“Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe, \n","and command them: ‘Take up for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests were standing, carry them with you, and set them down in the place where you spend the night.’” \n   \n","So Joshua summoned the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe, \n","and said to them, “Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, \n","to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’ \n","you are to tell them, ‘The waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters were cut off.’ Therefore these stones will be a memorial to the Israelites forever.” \n   \n","Thus the Israelites did as Joshua had commanded them. They took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, one for each tribe of Israel, just as the LORD had told Joshua; and they carried them to the camp, where they set them down. \n   \n","Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood. And the stones are there to this day. \n   \n","Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until the people had completed everything the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell them, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried across, \n","and after everyone had finished crossing, the priests with the ark of the LORD crossed in the sight of the people. \n","The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over before the Israelites, armed for battle as Moses had instructed them. \n","About 40,000 troops armed for battle crossed over before the LORD into the plains of Jericho. \n   \n","On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they revered him all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Joshua, \n","“Command the priests who carry the ark of the Testimony  to come up from the Jordan.” \n   \n","So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up from the Jordan.” \n   \n","When the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up out of the Jordan and their feet touched the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their course and overflowed all the banks as before. \n   \n","On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho. \n","And there at Gilgal Joshua set up the twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan. \n   \n","Then Joshua said to the Israelites, “In the future, when your children ask their fathers, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’ \n","you are to tell them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’ \n","For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as He did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over. \n","He did this so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, and so that you may always fear the LORD your God.” \n"],["Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast   heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, their hearts melted and their spirits failed for fear of the Israelites. \n   \n","At that time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel once again. ” \n","So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth. \n   \n","Now this is why Joshua circumcised them: All those who came out of Egypt—all the men of war—had died on the journey in the wilderness after they had left Egypt. \n","Though all who had come out were circumcised, none of those born in the wilderness on the journey from Egypt had been circumcised. \n   \n","For the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness forty years, until all the nation’s men of war who had come out of Egypt had died, since they did not obey the LORD. So the LORD vowed never to let them see the land He had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. \n","And Joshua raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones he circumcised. Until this time they were still uncircumcised, since they had not been circumcised along the way. \n   \n","And after all the nation had been circumcised, they stayed there in the camp until they were healed. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So that place has been called Gilgal  to this day. \n   \n","On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while the Israelites were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they kept the Passover. \n","The day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain from the produce of the land. \n   \n","And the day after they had eaten from the produce of the land, the manna ceased. There was no more manna for the Israelites, so that year they began to eat the crops of the land of Canaan. \n   \n","Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in His hand. Joshua approached Him and asked, “Are You for us or for our enemies?” \n   \n","“Neither,” He replied. “I have now come as Commander of the LORD’s army.” \n  Then Joshua fell facedown in reverence  and asked Him, “What does my Lord have to say to His servant?” \n   \n","The Commander of the LORD’s army replied, “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.” \n  And Joshua did so. \n"],["Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in. \n   \n","And the LORD said to Joshua, “Behold, I have delivered Jericho into your hand, along with its king and its mighty men of valor. \n","March around the city with all the men of war, circling the city one time. Do this for six days. \n","Have seven priests carry seven rams’ horns in front of the ark.

Then the wall of the city will collapse   and all your people will charge straight into the city. ” \n   \n","So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said, “Take up the ark of the covenant and have seven priests carry seven rams’ horns in front of the ark of the LORD.” \n   \n","And he told the people, “Advance and march around the city, with the armed troops going ahead of the ark of the LORD.” \n   \n","After Joshua had spoken to the people, seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns before the LORD advanced and blew the horns, and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. \n","While the horns continued to sound, the armed troops marched ahead of the priests who blew the horns, and the rear guard followed the ark. \n   \n","But Joshua had commanded the people: “Do not give a battle cry or let your voice be heard; do not let one word come out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout. Then you are to shout!” \n","So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city, circling it once. And the people returned to the camp and spent the night there. \n   \n","Joshua got up early the next morning, and the priests took the ark of the LORD. \n","And the seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns kept marching ahead of the ark of the LORD and blowing the horns. The armed troops went in front of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, while the horns kept sounding. \n","So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days. \n   \n","Then on the seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched around the city seven times in the same manner. That was the only day they circled the city seven times. \n","After the seventh time around, the priests blew the horns, and Joshua commanded the people, “Shout! For the LORD has given you the city! \n","Now the city and everything in it must be devoted to the LORD for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all those with her in her house will live, because she hid the spies we sent. \n","But keep away from the things devoted to destruction, lest you yourself be set apart for destruction. If you take any of these, you will set apart the camp of Israel for destruction and bring disaster upon it. \n","For all the silver and gold and all the articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD; they must go into His treasury.” \n   \n","So when the rams’ horns sounded, the people shouted. When they heard the blast of the horn, the people gave a great shout, and the wall collapsed. Then all the people charged straight into the city and captured it. \n","At the edge of the sword they devoted to destruction everything in the city—man and woman, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys. \n   \n","Meanwhile, Joshua told the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the house of the prostitute and bring out the woman and all who are with her, just as you promised her.” \n","So the young spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out her whole family and settled them outside the camp of Israel. \n   \n","Then the Israelites burned up the city and everything in it. However, they put the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD’s house. \n","And Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her father’s household and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho. So she has lived among the Israelites to this day. \n   \n","At that time Joshua invoked this solemn oath: \n  “Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up \n and rebuilds this city, Jericho; \n at the cost of his firstborn \n he will lay its foundations; \n at the cost of his youngest \n he will set up its gates.” \n   \n","So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land. \n"],["The Israelites, however, acted unfaithfully regarding the things devoted to destruction.  Achan   son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of what was set apart. So the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites. \n   \n","Meanwhile, Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai. \n   \n","On returning to Joshua, they reported, “There is no need to send all the people; two or three thousand men are enough to go up and attack Ai. Since the people of Ai are so few, you need not wear out all our people there.” \n   \n","So about three thousand men went up, but they fled before the men of Ai. \n","And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of them, chasing them from the gate as far as the quarries  and striking them down on the slopes. So the hearts of the people melted and became like water. \n   \n","Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown before the ark of the LORD until evening, as did the elders of Israel; and they all sprinkled dust on their heads. \n   \n","“O, Lord GOD,” Joshua said, “why did You ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to be destroyed? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan! \n","O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has turned its back and run from its enemies? \n","When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this, they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?” \n   \n","But the LORD said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why have you fallen on your face? \n","Israel has sinned; they have transgressed My covenant that I commanded them, and they have taken some of what was devoted to destruction. Indeed, they have stolen and lied, and they have put these things with their own possessions. \n","This is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies. They will turn their backs and run from their enemies, because they themselves have been set apart for destruction. I will no longer be with you unless you remove from among you whatever is devoted to destruction. \n   \n","Get up and consecrate the people, saying, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Among you, O Israel, there are things devoted to destruction. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them. \n","In the morning you must present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that the LORD selects shall come forward clan by clan, and the clan that the LORD selects shall come forward family by family, and the family that the LORD selects shall come forward man by man. \n","The one who is caught with the things devoted to destruction must be burned, along with all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD and committed an outrage in Israel.’” \n   \n","So Joshua arose early the next morning and had Israel come forward tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected. \n","He had the clans of Judah come forward, and the clan of the Zerahites was selected. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward, and the family of Zabdi was selected. \n","And he had the family of Zabdi come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected. \n   \n","So Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and make a confession to Him. I urge you to tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.” \n   \n","“It is true,” Achan replied, “I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I did: \n","When I saw among the spoils a beautiful cloak from Shinar,  two hundred shekels of silver,  and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.” \n   \n","So Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent, and there it all was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. \n","They took the things from inside the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out before the LORD. \n   \n","Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his oxen and donkeys and sheep, his tent, and everything else he owned, and brought them to the Valley of Achor. \n   \n","“Why have you brought this trouble upon us?” said Joshua. “Today the LORD will bring trouble upon you!” And all Israel stoned him to death. Then they stoned the others and burned their bodies. \n","And they heaped over Achan a large pile of rocks that remains to this day. So the LORD turned from His burning anger. Therefore that place is called the Valley of Achor  to this day. \n"],["Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid or discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. See, I have delivered into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land. \n","And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set up an ambush behind the city.” \n   \n","So Joshua and the whole army set out to attack Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out at night \n","with these orders: “Pay attention. You are to lie in ambush behind the city, not too far from it. All of you must be ready. \n","Then I and all the troops with me will advance on the city. When they come out against us as they did the first time, we will flee from them. \n","They will pursue us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, ‘The Israelites are running away from us as they did before.’ So as we flee from them, \n","you are to rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand. \n","And when you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do as the LORD has commanded! See, I have given you orders.” \n   \n","So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. But Joshua spent that night among the people. \n   \n","Joshua got up early the next morning and mobilized his men, and he and the elders of Israel marched before them up to Ai. \n","Then all the troops who were with him marched up and approached the city. They arrived in front of Ai and camped to the north of it, with the valley between them and the city. \n   \n","Now Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set up an ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. \n","So the forces were stationed with the main camp to the north of the city and the rear guard to the west of the city. And that night Joshua went into the valley. \n   \n","When the king of Ai saw the Israelites, he hurried out early in the morning with the men of the city to engage them in battle at an appointed place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set up against him behind the city. \n","Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten back before them, and they fled toward the wilderness. \n","Then all the men of Ai were summoned to pursue them, and they followed Joshua and were drawn away from the city. \n","Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel, leaving the city wide open while they pursued Israel. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Hold out your battle lance  toward Ai, for into your hand I will deliver the city.” So Joshua held out his battle lance toward Ai, \n","and as soon as he did so, the men in ambush rose quickly from their position. They rushed forward, entered the city, captured it, and immediately set it on fire. \n   \n","When the men of Ai turned and looked back, the smoke of the city was rising into the sky. They could not escape in any direction, and the troops who had fled to the wilderness now became the pursuers. \n","When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that smoke was rising from it, they turned around and struck down the men of Ai. \n","Meanwhile, those in the ambush came out of the city against them, and the men of Ai were trapped between the Israelite forces on both sides. So Israel struck them down until no survivor or fugitive remained. \n","But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua. \n   \n","When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai who had pursued them into the field and wilderness, and when every last one of them had fallen by the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and put it to the sword as well. \n","A total of twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai. \n","Joshua did not draw back the hand that held his battle lance until he had devoted to destruction  all who lived in Ai. \n","Israel took for themselves only the cattle and plunder of that city, as the LORD had commanded Joshua. \n   \n","So Joshua burned Ai  and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolation to this day. \n","He hung the king of Ai on a tree  until evening, and at sunset Joshua commanded that they take down the body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And over it they raised a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. \n   \n","At that time Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal to the LORD, the God of Israel, \n","just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: “an altar of uncut stones on which no iron tool has been used.” And on it they offered burnt offerings to the LORD, and they sacrificed peace offerings. \n   \n","And there in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua inscribed on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written. \n","All Israel, foreigners and citizens alike, with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD facing the Levitical priests who carried it. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded earlier, to bless the people of Israel. \n   \n","Afterward, Joshua read aloud all the words of the law—the blessings and the curses—according to all that is written in the Book of the Law. \n","There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua failed to read before the whole assembly of Israel, including the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who lived among them. \n"],["Now when news of this reached all the kings west of the Jordan—those in the hill country, the foothills,  and all along the coast of the Great Sea  toward Lebanon (the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites)—\n","they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel. \n   \n","But the people of Gibeon, having heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, \n","acted deceptively and set out as envoys, carrying on their donkeys worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended. \n","They put worn, patched sandals on their feet and threadbare clothing on their bodies, and their whole supply of bread was dry and moldy. \n","They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant land; please make a treaty  with us.” \n   \n","But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you dwell near us. How can we make a treaty with you?” \n   \n","“We are your servants,” they said to Joshua. \n  Then Joshua asked them, “Who are you and where have you come from?” \n   \n","“Your servants have come from a very distant land,” they replied, “because of the fame of the LORD your God. For we have heard the reports about Him: all that He did in Egypt, \n","and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth. \n","So the elders and inhabitants of our land told us, ‘Take provisions for your journey; go to meet them and say to them: We are your servants. Please make a treaty with us.’ \n   \n","This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But take a look, it is now dry and moldy. \n","These wineskins were new when we filled them, but look, they are cracked. And these clothes and sandals are worn out from our very long journey.” \n   \n","Then the men of Israel sampled their provisions, but did not seek the counsel of the LORD. \n","And Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them. \n   \n","Three days after they had made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites learned that they were neighbors, living among them. \n","So the Israelites set out and on the third day arrived at their cities—Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. \n","But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders. \n   \n","All the leaders answered, “We have sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them. \n","This is how we will treat them: We will let them live, so that no wrath will fall on us because of the oath we swore to them.” \n","They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the whole congregation.” So the leaders kept their promise. \n   \n","Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by telling us you live far away from us, when in fact you live among us? \n","Now therefore you are under a curse and will perpetually serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.” \n   \n","The Gibeonites answered, “Your servants were told clearly that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land and wipe out all its inhabitants before you. So we greatly feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we have done this. \n","Now we are in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.” \n   \n","So Joshua did this and delivered them from the hands of the Israelites, and they did not kill the Gibeonites. \n","On that day he made them woodcutters and water carriers, as they are to this day for the congregation of the LORD and for the altar at the place He would choose. \n"],["Now Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and devoted it to destruction  —doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king—and that the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living near them. \n","So Adoni-zedek and his people were greatly alarmed, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty. \n   \n","Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying, \n","“Come up and help me. We will attack Gibeon, because they have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.” \n   \n","So the five kings of the Amorites—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon—joined forces and advanced with all their armies. They camped before Gibeon and made war against it. \n   \n","Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: “Do not abandon your servants. Come quickly and save us! Help us, because all the kings of the Amorites from the hill country have joined forces against us.” \n   \n","So Joshua and his whole army, including all the mighty men of valor, came from Gilgal. \n   \n","The LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have delivered them into your hand. Not one of them shall stand against you.” \n   \n","After marching all night from Gilgal, Joshua caught them by surprise. \n","And the LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, who defeated them in a great slaughter at Gibeon, pursued them along the ascent to Beth-horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah. \n","As they fled before Israel along the descent from Beth-horon to Azekah, the LORD cast down on them large hailstones from the sky, and more of them were killed by the hailstones than by the swords of the Israelites. \n   \n","On the day that the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua spoke to the LORD in the presence of Israel: \n  “O sun, stand still over Gibeon, \n O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.” \n   \n","So the sun stood still \n and the moon stopped \n until the nation took vengeance \n upon its enemies. \n  Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? \n  “So the sun stopped \n in the middle of the sky \n and delayed going down \n about a full day.” \n   \n","There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man, because the LORD fought for Israel. \n   \n","Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal. \n   \n","Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah. \n","And Joshua was informed: “The five kings have been found; they are hiding in the cave at Makkedah.” \n   \n","So Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and post men there to guard them. \n","But you, do not stop there. Pursue your enemies and attack them from behind. Do not let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.” \n   \n","So Joshua and the Israelites continued to inflict a terrible slaughter until they had finished them off, and the remaining survivors retreated to the fortified cities. \n","The whole army returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one dared to utter a word against the Israelites. \n   \n","Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.” \n","So they brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon. \n   \n","When they had brought the kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had accompanied him, “Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” \n  So the commanders came forward and put their feet on their necks. \n   \n","“Do not be afraid or discouraged,” Joshua said. “Be strong and courageous, for the LORD will do this to all the enemies you fight.” \n   \n","After this, Joshua struck down and killed the kings, and he hung their bodies on five trees  and left them there until evening. \n","At sunset Joshua ordered that they be taken down from the trees and thrown into the cave in which they had hidden. Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave, and the stones are there to this day. \n   \n","On that day Joshua captured Makkedah and put it to the sword, along with its king. He devoted to destruction everyone in the city, leaving no survivors. So he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho. \n   \n","Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah. \n","And the LORD also delivered that city and its king into the hand of Israel, and Joshua put all the people to the sword, leaving no survivors. And he did to the king of Libnah as he had done to the king of Jericho. \n   \n","And Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish. They laid siege to it and fought against it. \n","And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, and Joshua captured it on the second day. He put all the people to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah. \n   \n","At that time Horam king of Gezer went to help Lachish, but Joshua struck him down along with his people, leaving no survivors. \n   \n","So Joshua moved on from Lachish to Eglon, and all Israel with him. They laid siege to it and fought against it. \n","That day they captured Eglon and put it to the sword, and Joshua devoted to destruction everyone in the city, just as he had done to Lachish. \n   \n","Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and fought against it. \n","They captured it and put to the sword its king, all its villages, and all the people. Joshua left no survivors, just as he had done at Eglon; he devoted to destruction Hebron and everyone in it. \n   \n","Finally Joshua and all Israel with him turned toward Debir and fought against it. \n","And they captured Debir, its king, and all its villages. They put them to the sword and devoted to destruction everyone in the city, leaving no survivors. Joshua did to Debir and its king as he had done to Hebron and as he had done to Libnah and its king. \n   \n","So Joshua conquered the whole region—the hill country, the Negev, the foothills, and the slopes, together with all their kings—leaving no survivors. He devoted to destruction everything that breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded. \n","Joshua conquered the area from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and the whole region of Goshen as far as Gibeon. \n   \n","And because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel, Joshua captured all these kings and their land in one campaign. \n","Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal. \n"],["Now when Jabin king of Hazor heard about these things, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon; to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph; \n","to the kings of the north in the mountains, in the Arabah south of Chinnereth, in the foothills,  and in Naphoth-dor  to the west; \n","to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah. \n   \n","So these kings came out with all their armies, a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore, along with a great number of horses and chariots. \n","All these kings joined forces and encamped at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for by this time tomorrow I will deliver all of them slain before Israel. You are to hamstring their horses and burn up their chariots.” \n   \n","So by the waters of Merom, Joshua and his whole army came upon them suddenly and attacked them, \n","and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them down and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh. They struck them down, leaving no survivors. \n","Joshua treated them as the LORD had told him; he hamstrung their horses and burned up their chariots. \n   \n","At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword, because Hazor was formerly the head of all these kingdoms. \n","The Israelites put everyone in Hazor to the sword, devoting them to destruction. Nothing that breathed remained, and Joshua burned down Hazor itself. \n   \n","Joshua captured all these kings and their cities and put them to the sword. He devoted them to destruction, as Moses the LORD’s servant had commanded. \n","Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds, except Hazor, which Joshua burned. \n   \n","The Israelites took for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but they put all the people to the sword until they had completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone who breathed. \n","As the LORD had commanded His servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua. That is what Joshua did, leaving nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses. \n   \n","So Joshua took this entire region: the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah, and the mountains of Israel and their foothills, \n","from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and struck them down, putting them to death. \n   \n","Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long period of time. \n","No city made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites living in Gibeon; all others were taken in battle. \n","For it was of the LORD to harden  their hearts to engage Israel in battle, so that they would be set apart for destruction and would receive no mercy, being annihilated as the LORD had commanded Moses. \n   \n","At that time Joshua proceeded to eliminate the Anakim from the hill country of Hebron, Debir, and Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah and of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction, along with their cities. \n","No Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites; only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did any survive. \n   \n","So Joshua took the entire land, in keeping with all that the LORD had spoken to Moses. And Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to the allotments to their tribes. Then the land had rest from war. \n"],["Now these are the kings of the land whom the Israelites struck down and whose lands they took beyond the Jordan to the east, from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon, including all the Arabah eastward: \n   \n","Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon. He ruled from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along the middle of the valley, up to the Jabbok River (the border of the Ammonites), that is, half of Gilead, \n","as well as the Arabah east of the Sea of Chinnereth   to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea  ), eastward through Beth-jeshimoth, and southward below the slopes of Pisgah. \n   \n","And Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei. \n","He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, all of Bashan up to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. \n   \n","Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the Israelites had struck them down and given their land as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. \n   \n","And these are the kings of the land that Joshua and the Israelites conquered beyond the Jordan to the west, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir (according to the allotments to the tribes of Israel, Joshua gave them as an inheritance \n","the hill country, the foothills, the Arabah, the slopes, the wilderness, and the Negev—the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites): \n   \n","the king of Jericho, one; \n  the king of Ai, which is near Bethel, one; \n   \n","the king of Jerusalem, one; \n  the king of Hebron, one; \n   \n","the king of Jarmuth, one; \n  the king of Lachish, one; \n   \n","the king of Eglon, one; \n  the king of Gezer, one; \n   \n","the king of Debir, one; \n  the king of Geder, one; \n   \n","the king of Hormah, one; \n  the king of Arad, one; \n   \n","the king of Libnah, one; \n  the king of Adullam, one; \n   \n","the king of Makkedah, one; \n  the king of Bethel, one; \n   \n","the king of Tappuah, one; \n  the king of Hepher, one; \n   \n","the king of Aphek, one; \n  the king of Lasharon, one; \n   \n","the king of Madon, one; \n  the king of Hazor, one; \n   \n","the king of Shimron-meron, one; \n  the king of Achshaph, one; \n   \n","the king of Taanach, one; \n  the king of Megiddo, one; \n   \n","the king of Kedesh, one; \n  the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; \n   \n","the king of Dor in Naphath-dor, one; \n  the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one; \n   \n","and the king of Tirzah, one. \n  So there were thirty-one kings in all. \n"],["Now Joshua was old and well along in years, and the LORD said to him, “You are old and well along in years, but very much of the land remains to be possessed. \n","This is the land that remains: \n  All the territory of the Philistines and the Geshurites, \n","from the Shihor east of Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the north (considered to be Canaanite territory)—that of the five Philistine rulers of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, as well as that of the Avvites; \n   \n","to the south, all the land of the Canaanites, from Mearah  of the Sidonians to Aphek, as far as the border of the Amorites; \n   \n","the land of the Gebalites; \n  and all Lebanon to the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath. \n   \n","All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim—all the Sidonians—I Myself will drive out before the Israelites.

You have no share in the LORD!’ So your descendants could cause ours to stop fearing the LORD. \n   \n","That is why we said, ‘Let us take action and build an altar for ourselves, but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices. \n","Rather, let it be a witness between us and you and the generations to come, that we will worship the LORD in His presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings.’ Then in the future, your descendants cannot say to ours, ‘You have no share in the LORD!’ \n   \n","Therefore we said, ‘If they ever say this to us or to our descendants, we will answer: Look at the replica of the altar of the LORD that our fathers made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.’ \n   \n","Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD and turn away from Him today by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices, other than the altar of the LORD our God, which stands before His tabernacle.” \n   \n","When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation—the heads of Israel’s clans who were with him—heard what the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh had to say, they were satisfied. \n","Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest said to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, “Today we know that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this breach of faith against Him.

And we likewise will go with you to your territory.” So the Simeonites went with them. \n   \n","When Judah attacked, the LORD delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek. \n","And there they found Adoni-bezek and fought against him, striking down the Canaanites and Perizzites. \n   \n","As Adoni-bezek fled, they pursued him, seized him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes. \n","Then Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have gathered the scraps under my table. As I have done to them, so God has repaid me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. \n   \n","Then the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire. \n","Afterward, the men of Judah marched down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, in the Negev, and in the foothills. \n   \n","Judah also marched against the Canaanites who were living in Hebron (formerly known as Kiriath-arba), and they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. \n   \n","From there they marched against the inhabitants of Debir (formerly known as Kiriath-sepher). \n","And Caleb said, “To the man who strikes down Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage.” \n","So Othniel son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz captured the city, and Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage. \n   \n","One day Acsah came to Othniel and urged him  to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you desire?” \n   \n","“Give me a blessing,” she answered. “Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me springs of water as well.” \n  So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs. \n   \n","Now the descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went up with the men of Judah from the City of Palms  to the Wilderness of Judah in the Negev near Arad. They went to live among the people. \n   \n","Then the men of Judah went with their brothers the Simeonites, attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and devoted the city to destruction.  So it was called Hormah. \n","And Judah also captured  Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron—each with its territory. \n","The LORD was with Judah, and they took possession of the hill country; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plains because they had chariots of iron. \n   \n","Just as Moses had promised, Judah gave Hebron to Caleb, who drove out the descendants of the three sons of Anak. \n   \n","The Benjamites, however, failed to drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. So to this day the Jebusites live there among the Benjamites. \n   \n","The house of Joseph also attacked Bethel, and the LORD was with them. \n","They sent spies to Bethel (formerly known as Luz), \n","and when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, “Please show us how to get into the city, and we will treat you kindly.” \n   \n","So the man showed them the entrance to the city, and they put the city to the sword but released that man and all his family. \n","And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called it Luz, which is its name to this day. \n   \n","At that time Manasseh failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and their villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land. \n","When Israel became stronger, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor, but they never drove them out completely. \n   \n","Ephraim also failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer; so the Canaanites continued to dwell among them in Gezer. \n   \n","Zebulun failed to drive out the inhabitants of Kitron and Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them and served as forced laborers. \n   \n","Asher failed to drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob. \n","So the Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, because they did not drive them out. \n   \n","Naphtali failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath.

They bowed down to them and provoked the LORD to anger, \n","for they forsook Him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths. \n   \n","Then the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of those who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist. \n","Wherever Israel marched out, the hand of the LORD was against them to bring calamity, just as He had sworn to them. So they were greatly distressed. \n   \n","Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them from the hands of those who plundered them. \n   \n","Israel, however, did not listen to their judges. Instead, they prostituted themselves with other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned from the way of their fathers, who had walked in obedience to the LORD’s commandments; they did not do as their fathers had done. \n   \n","Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for the Israelites, He was with that judge and saved them from the hands of their enemies while the judge was still alive; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning under those who oppressed them and afflicted them. \n","But when the judge died, the Israelites became even more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods to serve them and bow down to them. They would not give up their evil practices and stubborn ways. \n   \n","So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed the covenant I laid down for their fathers and has not heeded My voice, \n","I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died. \n","In this way I will test whether Israel will keep the way of the LORD by walking in it as their fathers did.” \n   \n","That is why the LORD had left those nations in place and had not driven them out immediately by delivering them into the hand of Joshua. \n"],["These are the nations that the LORD left to test all the Israelites who had not known any of the wars in Canaan, \n","if only to teach warfare to the subsequent generations of Israel, especially to those who had not known it formerly: \n","the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in the mountains of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath. \n   \n","These nations were left to test the Israelites, to find out whether they would keep the commandments of the LORD, which He had given their fathers through Moses. \n","Thus the Israelites continued to live among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. \n","And they took the daughters of these people in marriage, gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods. \n   \n","So the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD; they forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs. \n","Then the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram-naharaim, and the Israelites served him eight years. \n   \n","But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD, He raised up Othniel son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz as a deliverer to save them. \n","The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he became Israel’s judge and went out to war. And the LORD delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram into the hand of Othniel, who prevailed against him. \n   \n","So the land had rest for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died. \n   \n","Once again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD. So He gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. \n","After enlisting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join forces with him, Eglon attacked and defeated Israel, taking possession of the City of Palms. \n   \n","The Israelites served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years. \n","And again they cried out to the LORD, and He raised up Ehud son of Gera, a left-handed Benjamite, as their deliverer. So they sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab. \n   \n","Now Ehud had made for himself a double-edged sword a cubit long. He strapped it to his right thigh under his cloak \n","and brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was an obese man. \n   \n","After Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he ushered out those who had carried it. \n","But upon reaching the idols near Gilgal, he himself turned back and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” \n  “Silence,” said the king, and all his attendants left him. \n   \n","Then Ehud approached him while he was sitting alone in the coolness of his upper room. “I have a word from God for you,” Ehud said, and the king rose from his seat. \n   \n","And Ehud reached with his left hand, pulled the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into Eglon’s belly. \n","Even the handle sank in after the blade, and Eglon’s fat closed in over it, so that Ehud did not withdraw the sword from his belly. And Eglon’s bowels emptied. \n","Then Ehud went out through the porch, closing and locking the doors of the upper room behind him. \n   \n","After Ehud was gone, Eglon’s servants came in and found the doors of the upper room locked. “He must be relieving himself in the cool room,” they said. \n","So they waited until they became worried and saw that he had still not opened the doors of the upper room. Then they took the key and opened the doors—and there was their lord lying dead on the floor. \n   \n","Ehud, however, had escaped while the servants waited. He passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah. \n   \n","On arriving in Seirah, he blew the ram’s horn throughout the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites came down with him from the hills, and he became their leader. \n","“Follow me,” he told them, “for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” \n  So they followed him down and seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over. \n","At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men. Not one of them escaped. \n   \n","So Moab was subdued under the hand of Israel that day, and the land had rest for eighty years. \n   \n","After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath. And he too saved Israel, striking down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. \n"],["After Ehud died, the Israelites again did evil in the sight of the LORD. \n","So the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his forces was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim. \n","Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, because Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he had harshly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years. \n   \n","Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. \n","And she would sit under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, where the Israelites would go up to her for judgment. \n   \n","She summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “Surely the LORD, the God of Israel, is commanding you: ‘Go and march to Mount Tabor, taking with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun. \n","And I will draw out Sisera the commander of Jabin’s army, his chariots, and his troops to the River Kishon, and I will deliver him into your hand.’” \n   \n","Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.” \n   \n","“I will certainly go with you,” Deborah replied, “but the road you are taking will bring you no honor, because the LORD will be selling Sisera into the hand of a woman.” So Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh, \n","where he summoned Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand men followed him, and Deborah also went with him. \n   \n","Now Heber the Kenite had moved away from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law  of Moses, and had pitched his tent by the great tree of Zaanannim, which was near Kedesh. \n   \n","When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up Mount Tabor, \n","he summoned all nine hundred of his iron chariots and all the men with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the River Kishon. \n   \n","Then Deborah said to Barak, “Arise, for this is the day that the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not the LORD gone before you?” \n  So Barak came down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him. \n","And in front of him the LORD routed with the sword Sisera, all his charioteers, and all his army. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot. \n   \n","Then Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth-hagoyim, and the whole army of Sisera fell by the sword; not a single man was left. \n   \n","Meanwhile, Sisera had fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. \n","Jael went out to greet Sisera and said to him, “Come in, my lord. Come in with me. Do not be afraid.” So he entered her tent, and she covered him with a blanket. \n   \n","Sisera said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a container of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him again. \n   \n","“Stand at the entrance to the tent,” he said, “and if anyone comes and asks you, ‘Is there a man here?’ say, ‘No.’” \n   \n","But as he lay sleeping from exhaustion, Heber’s wife Jael took a tent peg, grabbed a hammer, and went silently to Sisera. She drove the peg through his temple and into the ground, and he died. \n   \n","When Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera, Jael went out to greet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man you are seeking.” So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera dead, with a tent peg through his temple. \n   \n","On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites. \n","And the hand of the Israelites grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan until they destroyed him. \n"],["On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song: \n   \n","“When the princes take the lead in Israel, \n when the people volunteer, \n bless the LORD. \n  \n","Listen, O kings!

And with the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down, take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering.” \n   \n","So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his father’s household and the men of the city, he did it by night rather than in the daytime. \n   \n","When the men of the city got up in the morning, there was Baal’s altar torn down, with the Asherah pole cut down beside it and the second bull offered up on the newly built altar. \n","“Who did this?” they said to one another. \n  And after they had investigated thoroughly, they were told, “Gideon son of Joash did it.” \n   \n","Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son.

Are you trying to save him? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If Baal is a god, let him contend for himself with the one who has torn down his altar.” \n   \n","So on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, “Let Baal contend with him,” because he had torn down Baal’s altar. \n   \n","Then all the Midianites, Amalekites, and other people of the east gathered together, crossed over the Jordan, and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. \n   \n","So the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, who blew the ram’s horn and rallied the Abiezrites behind him. \n","Calling them to arms, Gideon sent messengers throughout Manasseh, as well as Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, so that they came up to meet him. \n   \n","Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to save Israel by my hand, as You have said, \n","then behold, I will place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that You are going to save Israel by my hand, as You have said.” \n   \n","And that is what happened. When Gideon arose the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water. \n   \n","Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me; let me speak one more time.

Only the fleece was dry, and dew covered the ground. \n"],["Early in the morning Jerubbaal  (that is, Gideon) and all the men with him camped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Gideon, “You have too many people for Me to deliver Midian into their hands, lest Israel glorify themselves over Me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’ \n","Now, therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the people: ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.’” \n  So twenty-two thousand of them turned back, but ten thousand remained. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Gideon, “There are still too many people. Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go. But if I say, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.” \n   \n","So Gideon brought the people down to the water, and the LORD said to him, “Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel to drink.” \n","And the number of those who lapped the water with their hands to their mouths was three hundred men; all the others knelt to drink. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men who lapped the water I will save you and deliver the Midianites into your hand. But all the others are to go home.” \n   \n","So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred men, who took charge of the provisions and rams’ horns of the others. And the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley. \n   \n","That night the LORD said to Gideon, “Get up and go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand. \n","But if you are afraid to do so, then go down to the camp with your servant Purah \n","and listen to what they are saying. Then your hands will be strengthened to attack the camp.” So he went with Purah his servant to the outposts where armed men were guarding the camp. \n   \n","Now the Midianites, Amalekites, and all the other people of the east had settled in the valley like a swarm of locusts, and their camels were as countless as the sand on the seashore. \n","And as Gideon arrived, a man was telling his friend about a dream. “Behold, I had a dream,” he said, “and I saw a loaf of barley bread come tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent so hard that the tent overturned and collapsed.” \n   \n","His friend replied: “This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has delivered Midian and the whole camp into his hand.” \n   \n","When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. He returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Get up, for the LORD has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.” \n","And he divided the three hundred men into three companies and gave each man a ram’s horn in one hand and a large jar in the other, containing a torch. \n   \n","“Watch me and do as I do,” Gideon said. “When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do exactly as I do. \n","When I and all who are with me blow our horns, then you are also to blow your horns from all around the camp and shout, ‘For the LORD and for Gideon!’” \n   \n","Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after the changing of the guard. They blew their horns and broke the jars that were in their hands. \n","The three companies blew their horns and shattered their jars. Holding the torches in their left hands and the horns in their right hands, they shouted, “A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!” \n   \n","Each Israelite took his position around the camp, and the entire Midianite army fled, crying out as they ran. \n","And when the three hundred rams’ horns sounded, the LORD set all the men in the camp against one another with their swords. The army fled to Beth-shittah toward Zererah  as far as the border of Abel-meholah near Tabbath. \n","Then the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and they pursued the Midianites. \n   \n","Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim to say, “Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth-barah.” So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they captured the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth-barah. \n","They also captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. So they pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan. \n"],["Then the men of Ephraim said to Gideon, “Why have you done this to us? Why did you fail to call us when you went to fight against Midian?” And they contended with him violently. \n   \n","But Gideon answered them, “Now what have I accomplished compared to you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer? \n","God has delivered Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian, into your hand. What was I able to do compared to you?” When he had said this, their anger  against him subsided. \n   \n","Then Gideon and his three hundred men came to the Jordan and crossed it, exhausted yet still in pursuit. \n","So Gideon said to the men of Succoth, “Please give my troops some bread, for they are exhausted, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.” \n   \n","But the leaders of Succoth asked, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession, that we should give bread to your army?” \n   \n","“Very well,” Gideon replied, “when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with the thorns and briers of the wilderness!” \n   \n","From there he went up to Penuel  and asked the same from them, but the men of Penuel gave the same response as the men of Succoth. \n","So Gideon told the men of Penuel, “When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower!” \n   \n","Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army of about fifteen thousand men—all that were left of the armies of the people of the east. A hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had already fallen. \n","And Gideon went up by way of the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he attacked their army, taking them by surprise. \n","When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, Gideon pursued and captured these two kings of Midian, routing their entire army. \n   \n","After this, Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle along the Ascent of Heres. \n","There he captured a young man of Succoth and interrogated him. The young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven leaders and elders of Succoth. \n   \n","And Gideon went to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession, that we should give bread to your weary men?’” \n","Then he took the elders of the city, and using the thorns and briers of the wilderness, he disciplined the men of Succoth. \n","He also pulled down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city. \n   \n","Next, Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?” \n  “Men like you,” they answered, “each one resembling the son of a king.” \n   \n","“They were my brothers,” Gideon replied, “the sons of my mother! As surely as the LORD lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.” \n   \n","So he said to Jether, his firstborn, “Get up and kill them.” But the young man did not draw his sword; he was fearful because he was still a youth. \n   \n","Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Get up and kill us yourself, for as the man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments from the necks of their camels. \n   \n","Then the Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you and your son and grandson—for you have saved us from the hand of Midian.” \n   \n","But Gideon replied, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son. The LORD shall rule over you.” \n   \n","Then he added, “Let me make a request of you, that each of you give me an earring from his plunder.” (For the enemies had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites.) \n   \n","“We will give them gladly,” they replied. \n  So they spread out a garment, and each man threw an earring from his plunder onto it. \n","The weight of the gold earrings he had requested was 1,700 shekels, in addition to the crescent ornaments, the pendants, the purple garments of the kings of Midian, and the chains from the necks of their camels. \n   \n","From all this Gideon made an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his hometown. But soon all Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his household. \n   \n","In this way Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. So the land had rest for forty years in the days of Gideon, \n","and he—Jerubbaal  son of Joash—returned home and settled down. \n   \n","Gideon had seventy sons of his own, since he had many wives. \n","His concubine, who dwelt in Shechem, also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech. \n   \n","Later, Gideon son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. \n   \n","And as soon as Gideon was dead, the Israelites turned and prostituted themselves with the Baals, and they set up Baal-berith as their god. \n   \n","The Israelites failed to remember the LORD their God who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side. \n","They did not show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) for all the good things he had done for Israel. \n"],["Now Abimelech son of Jerubbaal  went to his mother’s brothers at Shechem and said to them and to all the clan of his mother, \n","“Please ask all the leaders of Shechem, ‘Is it better for you that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or just one man?’ Remember that I am your own flesh and blood.” \n   \n","And when his mother’s brothers spoke all these words about him in the presence of all the leaders of Shechem, their hearts were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.” \n","So they gave him seventy shekels of silver  from the temple of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired some worthless and reckless men to follow him. \n","He went to his father’s house in Ophrah, and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, because he hid himself. \n   \n","Then all the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo gathered beside the oak  at the pillar in Shechem and proceeded to make Abimelech their king. \n   \n","When this was reported to Jotham, he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim, raised his voice, and cried out: \n  “Listen to me, O leaders of Shechem, \n and may God listen to you. \n   \n","One day the trees set out \n to anoint a king for themselves. \n They said to the olive tree, \n ‘Reign over us.’ \n   \n","But the olive tree replied, \n ‘Should I stop giving my oil \n that honors both God and man, \n to hold sway over the trees?’ \n   \n","Then the trees said to the fig tree, \n ‘Come and reign over us.’ \n   \n","But the fig tree replied, \n ‘Should I stop giving my sweetness \n and my good fruit, \n to hold sway over the trees?’ \n   \n","Then the trees said to the grapevine, \n ‘Come and reign over us.’ \n   \n","But the grapevine replied, \n ‘Should I stop giving my wine \n that cheers both God and man, \n to hold sway over the trees?’ \n   \n","Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, \n ‘Come and reign over us.’ \n   \n","But the thornbush replied, \n ‘If you really are anointing me as king over you, \n come and find refuge in my shade. \n But if not, may fire come out of the thornbush \n and consume the cedars of Lebanon.’ \n   \n","Now if you have acted faithfully and honestly in making Abimelech king, if you have done well by Jerubbaal and his family, and if you have done to him as he deserves—\n","for my father fought for you and risked his life to deliver you from the hand of Midian, \n","but you have risen up against my father’s house this day and killed his seventy sons on a single stone, and you have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the leaders of Shechem because he is your brother—\n","if you have acted faithfully and honestly toward Jerubbaal and his house this day, then may you rejoice in Abimelech, and he in you. \n   \n","But if not, may fire come from Abimelech and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo, and may fire come from the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo and consume Abimelech.” \n   \n","Then Jotham ran away, escaping to Beer, and he lived there for fear of his brother Abimelech. \n   \n","After Abimelech had reigned over Israel for three years, \n","God sent a spirit of animosity  between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem and caused them to treat Abimelech deceitfully, \n","in order that the crime against the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come to justice and their blood be avenged on their brother Abimelech and on the leaders of Shechem, who had helped him murder his brothers. \n   \n","The leaders of Shechem set up an ambush against Abimelech on the hilltops, and they robbed all who passed by them on the road. So this was reported to Abimelech. \n   \n","Meanwhile, Gaal son of Ebed came with his brothers and crossed into Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem put their confidence in him. \n","And after they had gone out into the fields, gathered grapes from their vineyards, and trodden them, they held a festival and went into the house of their god; and as they ate and drank, they cursed Abimelech. \n   \n","Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? You are to serve the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem. Why should we serve Abimelech? \n","If only this people were under my authority, I would remove Abimelech; I would say to him, ‘Muster your army and come out!’” \n   \n","When Zebul the governor of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he burned with anger. \n","So he covertly sent messengers to Abimelech   to say, “Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem and are stirring up  the city against you. \n","Now then, tonight you and the people with you are to come and lie in wait in the fields. \n","And in the morning at sunrise, get up and advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out against you, do to them whatever you are able.” \n   \n","So Abimelech and all his troops set out by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies. \n   \n","Now Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate just as Abimelech and his men came out from their hiding places. \n   \n","When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the mountains!” \n  But Zebul replied, “The shadows of the mountains look like men to you.” \n   \n","Then Gaal spoke up again, “Look, people are coming down from the center of the land,  and one company is coming by way of the Diviners’ Oak. ” \n   \n","“Where is your gloating now?” Zebul replied. “You said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Are these not the people you ridiculed? Go out now and fight them!” \n   \n","So Gaal went out before the leaders of Shechem and fought against Abimelech, \n","but Abimelech pursued him, and Gaal fled before him. And many Shechemites fell wounded all the way to the entrance of the gate. \n","Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem. \n   \n","The next day the people of Shechem went out into the fields, and this was reported to Abimelech. \n","So he took his men, divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose up against them and attacked them. \n   \n","Then Abimelech and the companies with him rushed forward and took their stand at the entrance of the city gate. The other two companies rushed against all who were in the fields and struck them down. \n","And all that day Abimelech fought against the city until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he demolished the city and sowed it with salt. \n   \n","On hearing of this, all the leaders in the tower of Shechem entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith. \n","And when Abimelech was told that all the leaders in the tower of Shechem were gathered there, \n","he and all his men went up to Mount Zalmon. Abimelech took his axe in his hand and cut a branch from the trees, which he lifted to his shoulder, saying to his men, “Hurry and do what you have seen me do.” \n   \n","So each man also cut his own branch and followed Abimelech. Then they piled the branches against the inner chamber and set it on fire above them, killing everyone in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women. \n   \n","Then Abimelech went to Thebez, encamped against it, and captured it. \n","But there was a strong tower inside the city, and all the men, women, and leaders of the city fled there. They locked themselves in and went up to the roof of the tower. \n   \n","When Abimelech came to attack the tower, he approached its entrance to set it on fire. \n","But a woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, crushing his skull. \n","He quickly called his armor-bearer, saying, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’” \n  So Abimelech’s armor-bearer ran his sword through him, and he died. \n","And when the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went home. \n   \n","In this way God repaid the wickedness that Abimelech had done to his father in murdering his seventy brothers. \n","And God also brought all the wickedness of the men of Shechem back upon their own heads. So the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal came upon them. \n"],["After the time of Abimelech, a man of Issachar, Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo, rose up to save Israel. He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim. \n   \n","Tola judged  Israel twenty-three years, and when he died, he was buried in Shamir. \n   \n","Tola was followed by Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years. \n","He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys. And they had thirty towns in the land of Gilead, which to this day are called Havvoth-jair. \n   \n","When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon. \n   \n","And again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD. They served the Baals, the Ashtoreths, the gods of Aram, Sidon, and Moab, and the gods of the Ammonites and Philistines. Thus they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him. \n   \n","So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and Ammonites, \n","who that very year harassed and oppressed the Israelites, and did so for eighteen years to all the Israelites on the other side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites. \n   \n","The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, and Israel was in deep distress. \n   \n","Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, saying, “We have sinned against You, for we have indeed forsaken our God and served the Baals.” \n   \n","The LORD replied, “When the Egyptians, Amorites, Ammonites, Philistines, \n","Sidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites  oppressed you and you cried out to Me, did I not save you from their hands? \n","But you have forsaken Me and served other gods, so I will no longer save you. \n","Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you in your time of trouble.” \n   \n","“We have sinned,” the Israelites said to the LORD. “Deal with us as You see fit; but please deliver us today!” \n","So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD, and He could no longer bear the misery of Israel. \n   \n","Then the Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead, and the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah. \n","And the rulers of Gilead said to one another, “Whoever will launch the attack against the Ammonites will be the head of all who live in Gilead.” \n"],["Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor; he was the son of a prostitute, and Gilead was his father. \n","And Gilead’s wife bore him sons who grew up, drove Jephthah out, and said to him, “You shall have no inheritance in our father’s house, because you are the son of another woman.” \n   \n","So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where worthless men gathered around him and traveled with him. \n   \n","Some time later, when the Ammonites fought against Israel \n","and made war with them, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. \n","“Come,” they said, “be our commander, so that we can fight against the Ammonites.” \n   \n","Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me and expel me from my father’s house? Why then have you come to me now, when you are in distress?” \n   \n","They answered Jephthah, “This is why we now turn to you, that you may go with us, fight the Ammonites, and become leader over all of us who live in Gilead.” \n   \n","But Jephthah asked them, “If you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the LORD gives them to me, will I really be your leader?” \n   \n","And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The LORD is our witness if we do not do as you say.” \n   \n","So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him their leader and commander. And Jephthah repeated all his terms in the presence of the LORD at Mizpah. \n   \n","Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying, “What do you have against me that you have come to fight against my land?” \n   \n","The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah’s messengers, “When Israel came up out of Egypt, they seized my land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and all the way to the Jordan. Now, therefore, restore it peaceably.” \n   \n","Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites \n","to tell him, “This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or of the Ammonites. \n","But when Israel came up out of Egypt, they traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea  and came to Kadesh. \n","Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let us pass through your land,’ but the king of Edom would not listen. They also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel stayed in Kadesh. \n   \n","Then Israel traveled through the wilderness and bypassed the lands of Edom and Moab. They came to the east side of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, since the Arnon was its border. \n   \n","And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, ‘Please let us pass through your land into our own place.’ \n","But Sihon would not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So he gathered all his people, encamped in Jahaz, and fought with Israel. \n   \n","Then the LORD, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, who defeated them. So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites who inhabited that country, \n","seizing all the land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan. \n   \n","Now since the LORD, the God of Israel, has driven out the Amorites from before His people Israel, should you now possess it? \n","Do you not possess whatever your god Chemosh grants you? So also, we possess whatever the LORD our God has granted us. \n","Are you now so much better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend with Israel or fight against them? \n   \n","For three hundred years Israel has lived in Heshbon, Aroer, and their villages, as well as all the cities along the banks of the Arnon. Why did you not take them back during that time? \n","I have not sinned against you, but you have done me wrong by waging war against me. May the LORD, the Judge, decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites.” \n   \n","But the king of the Ammonites paid no heed to the message Jephthah sent him. \n   \n","Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, then through Mizpah of Gilead. And from there he advanced against the Ammonites. \n   \n","Jephthah made this vow to the LORD: “If indeed You will deliver the Ammonites into my hand, \n","then whatever comes out the door of my house to greet me on my triumphant return from the Ammonites will belong to the LORD, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.” \n   \n","So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the LORD delivered them into his hand. \n","With a great blow he devastated twenty cities from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel-keramim. So the Ammonites were subdued before the Israelites. \n   \n","And when Jephthah returned home to Mizpah, there was his daughter coming out to meet him with tambourines and dancing! She was his only child; he had no son or daughter besides her. \n   \n","As soon as Jephthah saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “No! Not my daughter! You have brought me to my knees! You have brought great misery upon me, for I have given my word to the LORD and cannot take it back.” \n   \n","“My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the LORD. Do to me as you have said, for the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.” \n","She also said to her father, “Let me do this one thing: Let me wander for two months through the mountains with my friends and mourn my virginity.” \n   \n","“Go,” he said. And he sent her away for two months. \n  So she left with her friends and mourned her virginity upon the mountains. \n","After two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she had never had relations with a man. \n  So it has become a custom in Israel \n","that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite. \n"],["Then the men of Ephraim assembled and crossed the Jordan to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why have you crossed over to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house down with you inside!” \n   \n","But Jephthah replied, “My people and I had a serious conflict with the Ammonites, and when I called, you did not save me out of their hands. \n","When I saw that you would not save me, I risked my life and crossed over to the Ammonites, and the LORD delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come today to fight against me?” \n   \n","Jephthah then gathered all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, “You Gileadites are fugitives in Ephraim, living in the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh.” \n   \n","The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a fugitive from Ephraim would say, “Let me cross over,” the Gileadites would ask him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” \n  If he answered, “No,” \n","they told him, “Please say Shibboleth.” \n  If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce it correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. So at that time 42,000 Ephraimites were killed. \n   \n","Jephthah judged Israel six years, and when he died, he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. \n   \n","After Jephthah, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. \n","He had thirty sons, as well as thirty daughters whom he gave in marriage to men outside his clan; and for his sons he brought back thirty wives from elsewhere. Ibzan judged Israel seven years. \n","Then Ibzan died, and he was buried in Bethlehem. \n   \n","After Ibzan, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel ten years. \n","Then Elon the Zebulunite died, and he was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. \n   \n","After Elon, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, judged Israel. \n","He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. And he judged Israel eight years. \n","Then Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, died, and he was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites. \n"],["Again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD, so He delivered them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years. \n   \n","Now there was a man from Zorah named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, whose wife was barren and had no children. \n","The angel  of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “It is true that you are barren and have no children; but you will conceive and give birth to a son. \n","Now please be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and not to eat anything unclean. \n","For behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. And no razor shall come over his head, because the boy will be a Nazirite  to God from the womb, and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hand of the Philistines.” \n   \n","So the woman went and told her husband, “A man of God came to me. His appearance was like the angel of God, exceedingly awesome. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name. \n","But he said to me, ‘Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. Now, therefore, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.’” \n   \n","Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, “Please, O Lord, let the man of God You sent us come to us again to teach us how to raise the boy who is to be born.” \n   \n","And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God returned to the woman as she was sitting in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her. \n","The woman ran quickly to tell her husband, “Behold, the man who came to me the other day has reappeared!” \n   \n","So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?” \n  “I am,” he said. \n   \n","Then Manoah asked, “When your words come to pass, what will be the boy’s rule of life and mission?” \n   \n","So the angel of the LORD answered Manoah, “Your wife is to do everything I told her. \n","She must not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor drink any wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.” \n   \n","“Please stay here,” Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “and we will prepare a young goat for you.” \n   \n","And the angel of the LORD replied, “Even if I stay, I will not eat your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD.” For Manoah did not know that it was the angel of the LORD. \n   \n","Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes to pass?” \n   \n","“Why do you ask my name,” said the angel of the LORD, “since it is beyond comprehension?” \n   \n","Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the LORD. And as Manoah and his wife looked on, the LORD did a marvelous thing. \n","When the flame went up from the altar to the sky, the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame. \n  When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell facedown to the ground. \n","And when the angel of the LORD did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it had been the angel of the LORD. \n   \n","“We are going to die,” he said to his wife, “for we have seen God!” \n   \n","But his wife replied, “If the LORD had intended to kill us, He would not have accepted the burnt offering and the grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things or spoken to us this way.” \n   \n","So the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The boy grew, and the LORD blessed him. \n","And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him at Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. \n"],["One day Samson went down to Timnah, where he saw a young Philistine woman. \n","So he returned and told his father and mother, “I have seen a daughter of the Philistines in Timnah. Now get her for me as a wife.” \n   \n","But his father and mother replied, “Can’t you find a young woman among your relatives or among any of our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?” \n  But Samson told his father, “Get her for me, for she is pleasing to my eyes.” \n","(Now his father and mother did not know this was from the LORD, who was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines; for at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.) \n   \n","Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother and came to the vineyards of Timnah. Suddenly a young lion came roaring at him, \n","and the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him, and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as one would tear a young goat. But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done. \n","Then Samson continued on his way down and spoke to the woman, because she was pleasing to his eyes. \n   \n","When Samson returned later to take her, he left the road to see the lion’s carcass, and in it was a swarm of bees, along with their honey. \n","So he scooped some honey into his hands and ate it as he went along. And when he returned to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion’s carcass. \n   \n","Then his father went to visit the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, as was customary for the bridegroom. \n","And when the Philistines saw him, they selected thirty men to accompany him. \n   \n","“Let me tell you a riddle,” Samson said to them. “If you can solve it for me within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes. \n","But if you cannot solve it, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.” \n  “Tell us your riddle,” they replied. “Let us hear it.” \n   \n","So he said to them: \n  “Out of the eater came something to eat, \n and out of the strong came something sweet.” \n  For three days they were unable to explain the riddle. \n","So on the fourth  day they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband to explain the riddle to us, or we will burn you and your father’s household to death. Did you invite us here to rob us?” \n   \n","Then Samson’s wife came to him, weeping, and said, “You hate me! You do not really love me! You have posed to my people a riddle, but have not explained it to me.” \n  “Look,” he said, “I have not even explained it to my father or mother, so why should I explain it to you?” \n   \n","She wept the whole seven days of the feast, and finally on the seventh day, because she had pressed him so much, he told her the answer. And in turn she explained the riddle to her people. \n   \n","Before sunset on the seventh day, the men of the city said to Samson: \n  “What is sweeter than honey? \n And what is stronger than a lion?” \n  So he said to them: \n  “If you had not plowed with my heifer, \n you would not have solved my riddle!” \n   \n","Then the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave their clothes to those who had solved the riddle. And burning with anger, Samson returned to his father’s house, \n","and his wife was given to one of the men who had accompanied him. \n"],["Later on, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. “I want to go to my wife in her room,” he said. But her father would not let him enter. \n   \n","“I was sure that you thoroughly hated her,” said her father, “so I gave her to one of the men who accompanied you. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead.” \n   \n","Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless in doing harm to the Philistines.” \n   \n","Then Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes. And he took torches, turned the foxes tail-to-tail, and fastened a torch between each pair of tails. \n","Then he lit the torches and released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines, burning up the piles of grain and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves. \n   \n","“Who did this?” the Philistines demanded. \n  “It was Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite,” they were told. “For his wife was given to his companion.” \n  So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death. \n   \n","And Samson told them, “Because you have done this, I will not rest until I have taken vengeance upon you.” \n","And he struck them ruthlessly  with a great slaughter, and then went down and stayed in the cave at the rock of Etam. \n   \n","Then the Philistines went up, camped in Judah, and deployed themselves near the town of Lehi. \n   \n","“Why have you attacked us?” said the men of Judah. \n  The Philistines replied, “We have come to arrest Samson and pay him back for what he has done to us.” \n   \n","In response, three thousand men of Judah went to the cave at the rock of Etam, and they asked Samson, “Do you not realize that the Philistines rule over us? What have you done to us?” \n  “I have done to them what they did to me,” he replied. \n   \n","But they said to him, “We have come down to arrest you and hand you over to the Philistines.” \n  Samson replied, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.” \n   \n","“No,” they answered, “we will not kill you, but we will tie you up securely and hand you over to them.” So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock. \n   \n","When Samson arrived in Lehi, the Philistines came out shouting against him. And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him. The ropes on his arms became like burnt flax, and the bonds broke loose from his hands. \n","He found the fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and struck down a thousand men. \n","Then Samson said: \n  “With the jawbone of a donkey \n I have piled them into heaps. \n With the jawbone of a donkey \n I have slain a thousand men.” \n   \n","And when Samson had finished speaking, he cast the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi. \n   \n","And being very thirsty, Samson cried out to the LORD, “You have accomplished this great deliverance through Your servant. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?” \n   \n","So God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned, and he was revived. That is why he named it En-hakkore, and it remains in Lehi to this day. \n   \n","And Samson judged Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines. \n"],["One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute and went in to spend the night with her. \n   \n","When the Gazites heard that Samson was there, they surrounded that place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They were quiet throughout the night, saying, “Let us wait until dawn; then we will kill him.” \n   \n","But Samson lay there only until midnight, when he got up, took hold of the doors of the city gate and both gateposts, and pulled them out, bar and all. Then he put them on his shoulders and took them to the top of the mountain overlooking Hebron. \n   \n","Some time later, Samson fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. \n","The lords of the Philistines went to her and said, “Entice him and find out the source of his great strength and how we can overpower him to tie him up and subdue him. Then each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver. ” \n   \n","So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me the source of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued.” \n   \n","Samson told her, “If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I will become as weak as any other man.” \n   \n","So the lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied him up with them. \n","While the men were hidden in her room, she called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” \n  But he snapped the bowstrings like a strand of yarn seared by a flame. So the source of his strength remained unknown. \n   \n","Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have mocked me and lied to me! Now please tell me how you can be tied up.” \n   \n","He replied, “If they tie me up with new ropes that have never been used, I will become as weak as any other man.” \n   \n","So Delilah took new ropes, tied him up with them, and called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” \n  But while the men were hidden in her room, he snapped the ropes off his arms like they were threads. \n   \n","Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have mocked me and lied to me all along! Tell me how you can be tied up.” \n  He told her, “If you weave the seven braids of my head into the web of a loom and tighten it with a pin, I will become as weak as any other man.  ” \n   \n","So while he slept, Delilah took the seven braids of his hair and wove them into the web.  Then she tightened it with a pin and called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” \n  But he awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin with the loom and the web. \n   \n","“How can you say, ‘I love you,’” she asked, “when your heart is not with me? This is the third time you have mocked me and failed to reveal to me the source of your great strength!” \n   \n","Finally, after she had pressed him daily with her words and pleaded until he was sick to death, \n","Samson told her all that was in his heart: “My hair has never been cut, because I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, my strength will leave me, and I will become as weak as any other man.” \n   \n","When Delilah realized that he had revealed to her all that was in his heart, she sent this message to the lords of the Philistines: “Come up once more, for he has revealed to me all that is in his heart.” \n  Then the lords of the Philistines came to her, bringing the money in their hands. \n   \n","And having lulled him to sleep on her lap, she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his head. In this way she began to subdue him, and his strength left him. \n","Then she called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” \n  When Samson awoke from his sleep, he thought, “I will escape as I did before and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him. \n   \n","Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, where he was bound with bronze shackles and forced to grind grain in the prison. \n   \n","However, the hair of his head began to grow back after it had been shaved. \n   \n","Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They rejoiced and said, “Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hands.” \n   \n","And when the people saw him, they praised their god, saying: \n  “Our god has delivered into our hands \n our enemy who destroyed our land \n and multiplied our dead.” \n   \n","And while their hearts were merry, they said, “Call for Samson to entertain us.” So they called Samson out of the prison to entertain them. And they stationed him between the pillars. \n   \n","Samson said to the servant who held his hand, “Lead me where I can feel the pillars supporting the temple, so I can lean against them.” \n   \n","Now the temple was full of men and women; all the lords of the Philistines were there, and about three thousand men and women were on the roof watching Samson entertain them. \n   \n","Then Samson called out to the LORD: “O Lord GOD, please remember me. Strengthen me, O God, just once more, so that with one vengeful blow I may pay back the Philistines for my two eyes.” \n   \n","And Samson reached out for the two central pillars supporting the temple. Bracing himself against them with his right hand on one pillar and his left hand on the other, \n","Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines.” \n  Then he pushed with all his might, and the temple fell on the lords and all the people in it. So in his death he killed more than he had killed in his life. \n   \n","Then Samson’s brothers and his father’s family came down, carried him back, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. And he had judged Israel twenty years. \n"],["Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim \n","said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels of silver  that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse—I have the silver here with me; I took it.” \n  Then his mother said, “Blessed be my son by the LORD!” \n   \n","And when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, “I wholly dedicate the silver to the LORD for my son’s benefit, to make a graven image and a molten idol. Therefore I will now return it to you.” \n   \n","So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took two hundred shekels of silver  and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into a graven image and a molten idol. And they were placed in the house of Micah. \n   \n","Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household idols, and ordained  one of his sons as his priest. \n","In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes. \n   \n","And there was a young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah who had been residing within the clan of Judah. \n","This man left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to settle where he could find a place. And as he traveled, he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim. \n   \n","“Where are you from?” Micah asked him. \n  “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” he replied, “and I am on my way to settle wherever I can find a place.” \n   \n","“Stay with me,” Micah said to him, “and be my father and priest, and I will give you ten shekels of silver  per year, a suit of clothes, and your provisions.” \n  So the Levite went in \n","and agreed to stay with him, and the young man became like a son to Micah. \n   \n","Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house. \n","Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, because a Levite has become my priest.” \n"],["In those days there was no king in Israel, and the tribe of the Danites was looking for territory to occupy. For up to that time they had not come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. \n","So the Danites sent out five men from their clans, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore it. “Go and explore the land,” they told them. \n  The men entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night. \n","And while they were near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they went over and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?” \n   \n","“Micah has done this and that for me,” he replied, “and he has hired me to be his priest.” \n   \n","Then they said to him, “Please inquire of God to determine whether we will have a successful journey.” \n   \n","And the priest told them, “Go in peace. The LORD is watching over your journey.” \n   \n","So the five men departed and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living securely, like the Sidonians, tranquil and unsuspecting. There was nothing lacking in the land and no oppressive ruler. And they were far away from the Sidonians and had no alliance with anyone. \n   \n","When the men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers asked them, “What did you find?” \n   \n","They answered, “Come on, let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Why would you fail to act? Do not hesitate to go there and take possession of the land! \n","When you enter, you will come to an unsuspecting people and a spacious land, for God has delivered it into your hand. It is a place where nothing on earth is lacking.” \n   \n","So six hundred Danites departed from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war. \n","They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. That is why the place west of Kiriath-jearim is called Mahaneh-dan  to this day. \n","And from there they traveled to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house. \n   \n","Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish said to their brothers, “Did you know that one of these houses has an ephod, household gods, a graven image, and a molten idol? Now think about what you should do.” \n   \n","So they turned aside there and went to the home of the young Levite, the house of Micah, and greeted him. \n   \n","The six hundred Danites stood at the entrance of the gate, armed with their weapons of war. \n","And the five men who had gone to spy out the land went inside and took the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten idol, while the priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred armed men. \n   \n","When they entered Micah’s house and took the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten idol, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” \n   \n","“Be quiet,” they told him. “Put your hand over your mouth and come with us and be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest for the house of one person or a priest for a tribe and family in Israel?” \n   \n","So the priest was glad and took the ephod, the household idols, and the graven image, and went with the people. \n","Putting their small children, their livestock, and their possessions in front of them, they turned and departed. \n   \n","After they were some distance from Micah’s house, the men in the houses near Micah’s house mobilized and overtook the Danites. \n","When they called out after them, the Danites turned to face them and said to Micah, “What is the matter with you that you have called out such a company?” \n   \n","He replied, “You took the gods I had made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you say to me, ‘What is the matter with you?’” \n   \n","The Danites said to him, “Do not raise your voice against us, or angry men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.” \n   \n","So the Danites went on their way, and Micah turned to go back home, because he saw that they were too strong for him. \n   \n","After they had taken Micah’s idols and his priest, they went to Laish, to a tranquil and unsuspecting people, and they struck them with their swords and burned down the city. \n","There was no one to deliver them, because the city was far from Sidon and had no alliance with anyone; it was in a valley near Beth-rehob. \n  And the Danites rebuilt the city and lived there. \n","They named it Dan, after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel—though the city was formerly named Laish. \n   \n","The Danites set up idols for themselves, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. \n   \n","So they set up for themselves Micah’s graven image, and it was there the whole time the house of God was in Shiloh. \n"],["Now in those days, when there was no king in Israel, a Levite who lived in the remote hill country of Ephraim took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. \n","But she was unfaithful to him  and left him to return to her father’s house in Bethlehem in Judah. \n  After she had been there four months, \n","her husband got up and went after her to speak kindly to her and bring her back, taking his servant and a pair of donkeys. So the girl brought him into her father’s house, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him. \n","His father-in-law, the girl’s father, persuaded him to stay, so he remained with him three days, eating, drinking, and lodging there. \n   \n","On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning and prepared to depart, but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread, and then you can go.” \n","So they sat down and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the girl’s father said to the man, “Please agree to stay overnight and let your heart be merry.” \n","The man got up to depart, but his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night. \n   \n","On the fifth day, he got up early in the morning to depart, but the girl’s father said, “Please refresh your heart.” So they waited until late afternoon and the two of them ate. \n","When the man got up to depart with his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him, “Look, the day is drawing to a close. Please spend the night. See, the day is almost over. Spend the night here, that your heart may be merry. Then you can get up early tomorrow for your journey home.” \n   \n","But the man was unwilling to spend the night. He got up and departed, and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine. \n","When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, “Please, let us stop at this Jebusite city and spend the night here.” \n   \n","But his master replied, “We will not turn aside to the city of foreigners, where there are no Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.” \n","He continued, “Come, let us try to reach one of these towns to spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah.” \n   \n","So they continued on their journey, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin. \n","They stopped to go in and lodge in Gibeah. The Levite went in and sat down in the city square, but no one would take them into his home for the night. \n   \n","That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was residing in Gibeah (the men of that place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the field. \n","When he looked up and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, “Where are you going, and where have you come from?” \n   \n","The Levite replied, “We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote hill country of Ephraim, where I am from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and now I am going to the house of the LORD; but no one has taken me into his home, \n","even though there is both straw and feed for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me and the maidservant and young man with me. There is nothing that we, your servants, lack.” \n   \n","“Peace to you,” said the old man. “Let me supply everything you need. Only do not spend the night in the square.” \n","So he brought him to his house and fed his donkeys. And they washed their feet and ate and drank. \n   \n","While they were enjoying themselves, suddenly the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they said to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out the man who came to your house, so we can have relations with him!” \n   \n","The owner of the house went out and said to them, “No, my brothers, do not do this wicked thing! After all, this man is a guest in my house. Do not commit this outrage. \n","Look, let me bring out my virgin daughter and the man’s concubine, and you can use them and do with them as you wish. But do not do such a vile thing to this man.” \n   \n","But the men would not listen to him. So the Levite took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. \n","Early that morning, the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, collapsed at the doorway, and lay there until it was light. \n   \n","In the morning, when her master got up and opened the doors of the house to go out on his journey, there was his concubine, collapsed in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. \n","“Get up,” he told her. “Let us go.” But there was no response. So the man put her on his donkey and set out for home. \n   \n","When he reached his house, he picked up a knife, took hold of his concubine, cut her limb by limb into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout the territory of Israel. \n","And everyone who saw it said, “Nothing like this has been seen or done from the day the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt until this day. Think it over, take counsel, and speak up!” \n"],["Then all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came out, and the congregation assembled as one man before the LORD at Mizpah. \n","The leaders of all the people and all the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of God’s people: 400,000 men on foot, armed with swords. \n","(Meanwhile the Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) And the Israelites asked, “Tell us, how did this wicked thing happen?” \n   \n","So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered: “I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night. \n","And during the night, the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house. They intended to kill me, but they abused my concubine, and she died. \n","Then I took my concubine, cut her into pieces, and sent her throughout the land of Israel’s inheritance, because they had committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel. \n","Behold, all you Israelites, give your advice and verdict here and now.” \n   \n","Then all the people stood as one man and said, “Not one of us will return to his tent or to his house. \n","Now this is what we will do to Gibeah: We will go against it as the lot dictates. \n","We will take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to supply provisions for the army when they go to Gibeah  in Benjamin to punish them for the atrocity they have committed in Israel.” \n   \n","So all the men of Israel gathered as one man, united against the city. \n","And the tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that has occurred among you? \n","Hand over the wicked men of Gibeah so we can put them to death and purge Israel of this evil.” \n  But the Benjamites refused to heed the voice of their fellow Israelites. \n","And from their cities they came together at Gibeah to go out and fight against the Israelites. \n","On that day the Benjamites mobilized 26,000 swordsmen from their cities, in addition to the 700 select men of Gibeah. \n","Among all these soldiers there were 700 select left-handers, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair without missing. \n   \n","The Israelites, apart from Benjamin, mobilized 400,000 swordsmen, each one an experienced warrior. \n   \n","The Israelites set out, went up to Bethel, and inquired of God, “Who of us shall go up first to fight against the Benjamites?” \n  “Judah will be first,” the LORD replied. \n   \n","The next morning the Israelites set out and camped near Gibeah. \n","And the men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin and took up their battle positions at Gibeah. \n   \n","And the Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down 22,000 Israelites on the battlefield that day. \n   \n","But the Israelite army took courage and again took their battle positions in the same place where they had arrayed themselves on the first day. \n","They went up and wept before the LORD until evening, inquiring of Him, “Should we again draw near for battle against our brothers the Benjamites?” \n  And the LORD answered, “Go up against them.” \n   \n","On the second day the Israelites advanced against the Benjamites. \n","That same day the Benjamites came out against them from Gibeah and cut down another 18,000 Israelites, all of them armed with swords. \n   \n","Then the Israelites, all the people, went up to Bethel, where they sat weeping before the LORD. That day they fasted until evening and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD. \n","And the Israelites inquired of the LORD. (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there, \n","and Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, served before it.) The Israelites asked, “Should we again go out to battle against our brothers the Benjamites, or should we stop?” \n  The LORD answered, “Fight, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.” \n   \n","So Israel set up an ambush around Gibeah. \n","On the third day the Israelites went up against the Benjamites and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as they had done before. \n","The Benjamites came out against them and were drawn away from the city. They began to attack the people as before, killing about thirty men of Israel in the fields and on the roads, one of which led up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah. \n   \n","“We are defeating them as before,” said the Benjamites. \n  But the Israelites said, “Let us retreat and draw them away from the city onto the roads.” \n   \n","So all the men of Israel got up from their places and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar, and the Israelites in ambush charged from their positions west of Gibeah. \n","Then 10,000 select men from all Israel made a frontal assault against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce. But the Benjamites did not realize that disaster was upon them. \n","The LORD defeated Benjamin in the presence of Israel, and on that day the Israelites slaughtered 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords. \n","Then the Benjamites realized they had been defeated. \n  Now the men of Israel had retreated before Benjamin because they were relying on the ambush they had set against Gibeah. \n","The men in ambush rushed suddenly against Gibeah; they advanced and put the whole city to the sword. \n   \n","The men of Israel had arranged a signal with the men in ambush: When they sent up a great cloud of smoke from the city, \n","the men of Israel would turn in the battle. \n  When the Benjamites had begun to strike them down, killing about thirty men of Israel, they said, “They are defeated before us as in the first battle.” \n","But when the column of smoke began to go up from the city, the Benjamites looked behind them and saw the whole city going up in smoke. \n   \n","Then the men of Israel turned back on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified when they realized that disaster had come upon them. \n","So they fled before the men of Israel toward the wilderness, but the battle overtook them, and the men coming out of the cities struck them down there. \n","They surrounded the Benjamites, pursued them, and easily overtook them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east. \n","And 18,000 Benjamites fell, all men of valor. \n   \n","Then the Benjamites turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and Israel cut down 5,000 men on the roads. And they overtook them at Gidom and struck down 2,000 more. \n   \n","That day 25,000 Benjamite swordsmen fell, all men of valor. \n","But 600 men turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months. \n","And the men of Israel turned back against the other Benjamites and put to the sword all the cities, including the animals and everything else they found. And they burned down all the cities in their path. \n"],["Now the men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah, saying, “Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.” \n   \n","So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, lifting up their voices and weeping bitterly. \n","“Why, O LORD God of Israel,” they cried out, “has this happened in Israel? Today in Israel one tribe is missing!” \n   \n","The next day the people got up early, built an altar there, and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings. \n","The Israelites asked, “Who among all the tribes of Israel did not come to the assembly before the LORD?” For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to come up before the LORD at Mizpah would surely be put to death. \n   \n","And the Israelites grieved for their brothers, the Benjamites, and said, “Today a tribe is cut off from Israel. \n","What should we do about wives for the survivors, since we have sworn by the LORD not to give them our daughters in marriage?” \n   \n","So they asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to come up before the LORD at Mizpah?” And, in fact, no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the camp for the assembly. \n","For when the people were counted, none of the residents of Jabesh-gilead were there. \n   \n","So the congregation sent 12,000 of their most valiant men and commanded them: “Go and put to the sword those living in Jabesh-gilead, including women and children. \n","This is what you are to do: Devote to destruction  every male, as well as every female who has had relations with a man.” \n   \n","So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young women who had not had relations with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan. \n   \n","Then the whole congregation sent a message of peace to the Benjamites who were at the rock of Rimmon. \n","And at that time the Benjamites returned and were given the women who were spared from Jabesh-gilead. But there were not enough women for all of them. \n   \n","The people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a void in the tribes of Israel. \n   \n","Then the elders of the congregation said, “What should we do about wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?” \n","They added, “There must be heirs for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out. \n","But we cannot give them our daughters as wives.” \n  For the Israelites had sworn, “Cursed is he who gives a wife to a Benjamite.” \n   \n","“But look,” they said, “there is a yearly feast to the LORD in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel east of the road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.” \n   \n","So they commanded the Benjamites: “Go, hide in the vineyards \n","and watch. When you see the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, each of you is to come out of the vineyards, catch for himself a wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. \n","When their fathers or brothers come to us to complain, we will tell them, ‘Do us a favor by helping them, since we did not get wives for each of them in the war. Since you did not actually give them your daughters, you have no guilt.’” \n   \n","The Benjamites did as instructed and carried away the number of women they needed from the dancers they caught. They went back to their own inheritance, rebuilt their cities, and settled in them. \n","And at that time, each of the Israelites returned from there to his own tribe and clan, each to his own inheritance. \n   \n","In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes. "]],"Ruth":[["In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. And a certain man from Bethlehem in Judah, with his wife and two sons, went to reside in the land of Moab. \n","The man’s name was Elimelech, his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah, and they entered the land of Moab and settled there. \n   \n","Then Naomi’s husband Elimelech died, and she was left with her two sons, \n","who took Moabite women as their wives, one named Orpah and the other named Ruth. \n  And after they had lived in Moab about ten years, \n","both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and without her husband. \n   \n","When Naomi heard in Moab that the LORD had attended to His people by providing them with food, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to leave the land of Moab. \n","Accompanied by her two daughters-in-law, she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road leading back to the land of Judah. \n   \n","Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you to your mother’s home. May the LORD show you loving devotion, as you have shown to your dead and to me. \n","May the LORD enable each of you to find rest in the home of your new husband.” \n  And she kissed them as they wept aloud \n","and said, “Surely we will return with you to your people.” \n   \n","But Naomi replied, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you go with me? Are there still sons in my womb to become your husbands? \n","Return home, my daughters. Go on, for I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons, \n","would you wait for them to grow up? Would you refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.” \n   \n","Again they wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her. \n   \n","“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; follow her back home.” \n   \n","But Ruth replied: \n  “Do not urge me to leave you \n or to turn from following you. \n For wherever you go, I will go, \n and wherever you live, I will live; \n your people will be my people, \n and your God will be my God. \n  \n","Where you die, I will die, \n and there I will be buried. \n May the LORD punish me, \n and ever so severely, \n if anything but death \n separates you and me.” \n   \n","When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to persuade her. \n   \n","So Naomi and Ruth traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole city was stirred because of them, and the women of the city exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?” \n   \n","“Do not call me Naomi, ” she replied. “Call me Mara,  because the Almighty  has dealt quite bitterly with me. \n","I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? After all, the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me.” \n   \n","So Naomi returned from the land of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess. And they arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest. \n"],["Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a prominent man of noble character from the clan of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. \n   \n","And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go into the fields and glean heads of grain after someone in whose sight I may find favor.” \n  “Go ahead, my daughter,” Naomi replied. \n   \n","So Ruth departed and went out into the field and gleaned after the harvesters. And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech. \n   \n","Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, “The LORD be with you.” \n  “The LORD bless you,” they replied. \n   \n","And Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, “Whose young woman is this?” \n   \n","The foreman answered, “She is the Moabitess who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab. \n","She has said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the harvesters.’ So she came out and has continued from morning until now, except that she rested a short time in the shelter.” \n   \n","Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Do not go and glean in another field, and do not go away from this place, but stay here close to my servant girls. \n","Let your eyes be on the field they are harvesting, and follow along after these girls. Indeed, I have ordered the young men not to touch you. And when you are thirsty, go and drink from the jars the young men have filled.” \n   \n","At this, she fell on her face, bowing low to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you should take notice of me, even though I am a foreigner?” \n   \n","Boaz replied, “I have been made fully aware of all you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, how you left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and how you came to a people you did not know before. \n","May the LORD repay your work, and may you receive a rich reward from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have taken refuge.” \n   \n","“My lord,” she said, “may I continue to find favor in your eyes, for you have comforted and spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your servant girls.” \n   \n","At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here; have some bread and dip it into the vinegar sauce.” So she sat down beside the harvesters, and he offered her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left over. \n   \n","When Ruth got up to glean, Boaz ordered his young men, “Even if she gathers among the sheaves, do not insult her. \n","Rather, pull out for her some stalks from the bundles and leave them for her to gather. Do not rebuke her.” \n   \n","So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening. And when she beat out what she had gleaned, it was about an ephah of barley. \n","She picked up the grain and went into the town, where her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought out what she had saved from her meal and gave it to Naomi. \n   \n","Then her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today, and where did you work? Blessed be the man who noticed you.” \n  So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,” she said. \n   \n","Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by the LORD, who has not withdrawn His kindness from the living or the dead.” Naomi continued, “The man is a close relative. He is one of our kinsman-redeemers. ” \n   \n","Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also told me, ‘Stay with my young men until they have finished gathering all my harvest.’” \n   \n","And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, “My daughter, it is good for you to work with his young women, so that nothing will happen to you in another field.” \n   \n","So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean grain until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law. \n"],["One day Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, should I not seek a resting place for you, that it may be well with you? \n","Now is not Boaz, with whose servant girls you have been working, a relative of ours? In fact, tonight he is winnowing barley on the threshing floor. \n","Therefore wash yourself, put on perfume, and wear your best clothes. Go down to the threshing floor, but do not let the man know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. \n","When he lies down, note the place where he lies. Then go in and uncover his feet, and lie down, and he will explain to you what you should do.” \n   \n","“I will do everything you say,” Ruth answered. \n","So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do. \n   \n","After Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth went in secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down. \n   \n","At midnight, Boaz was startled, turned over, and there lying at his feet was a woman! \n   \n","“Who are you?” he asked. \n  “I am your servant Ruth,” she replied. “Spread the corner of your garment   over me, for you are a kinsman-redeemer. ” \n   \n","Then Boaz said, “May the LORD bless you, my daughter. You have shown more kindness now than before, because you have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor. \n","And now do not be afraid, my daughter. I will do for you whatever you request, since all my fellow townspeople know that you are a woman of noble character. \n","Yes, it is true that I am a kinsman-redeemer, but there is a redeemer nearer than I. \n","Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he wants to redeem you, good. Let him redeem you. But if he does not want to redeem you, as surely as the LORD lives, I will. Now lie here until morning.” \n   \n","So she lay down at his feet until morning, but she got up before anyone else could recognize her. \n  Then Boaz said, “Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.” \n","And he told her, “Bring the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” When she did so, he shoveled six measures of barley   into her shawl. Then he went  into the city. \n   \n","When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked her, “How did it go, my daughter?” \n  Then Ruth told her all that Boaz had done for her. \n","And she said, “He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said, ‘Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’” \n   \n","“Wait, my daughter,” said Naomi, “until you find out how things go, for he will not rest unless he has resolved the matter today.” \n"],["Meanwhile, Boaz went to the gate and sat down there. Soon the kinsman-redeemer  of whom he had spoken came along, and Boaz said, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.” So he went over and sat down. \n   \n","Then Boaz took ten of the elders of the city and said, “Sit here,” and they did so. \n   \n","And he said to the kinsman-redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech. \n","I thought I should inform you that you may buy it back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, do so. But if you  will not redeem it, tell me so I may know, because there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you.” \n  “I will redeem it,” he replied. \n   \n","Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the land from Naomi and also from Ruth the Moabitess, you must also acquire the widow of the deceased in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.” \n   \n","The kinsman-redeemer replied, “I cannot redeem it myself, or I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I cannot redeem it.” \n   \n","Now in former times in Israel, concerning the redemption or exchange of property, to make any matter legally binding a man would remove his sandal and give it to the other party, and this was a confirmation in Israel. \n","So the kinsman-redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” \n   \n","At this, Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon. \n","Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, to raise up the name of the deceased through his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his brothers or from the gate of his home. You are witnesses today.” \n   \n","“We are witnesses,” said the elders and all the people at the gate. “May the LORD make the woman entering your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you be prosperous in Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem. \n","And may your house become like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring the LORD will give you by this young woman.” \n   \n","So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And when he had relations with her, the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. \n   \n","Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a kinsman-redeemer. May his name become famous in Israel. \n","He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.” \n   \n","And Naomi took the child, placed him on her lap, and became a nurse to him. \n","The neighbor women said, “A son has been born to Naomi,” and they named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, the father of David. \n   \n","Now these are the generations of Perez: \n  Perez was the father of Hezron, \n   \n","Hezron was the father of Ram, \n  Ram was the father of Amminadab, \n   \n","Amminadab was the father of Nahshon, \n  Nahshon was the father of Salmon, \n   \n","Salmon was the father of Boaz, \n  Boaz was the father of Obed, \n   \n","Obed was the father of Jesse, \n  and Jesse was the father of David. "]],"I Samuel":[["Now there was a man named Elkanah who was from Ramathaim-zophim   in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. \n","He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. \n   \n","Year after year Elkanah would go up from his city to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts at Shiloh, where Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the LORD. \n","And whenever the day came for Elkanah to present his sacrifice, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. \n","But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved her even though the LORD had closed her womb. \n   \n","Because the LORD had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival would provoke her and taunt her viciously. \n","And this went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival taunted her until she wept and would not eat. \n   \n","“Hannah, why are you crying?” her husband Elkanah asked. “Why won’t you eat? Why is your heart so grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” \n   \n","So after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD. \n   \n","In her bitter distress, Hannah prayed to the LORD and wept with many tears. \n","And she made a vow, pleading, “O LORD of Hosts, if only You will look upon the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, not forgetting Your maidservant but giving her a son, then I will dedicate him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall ever come over his head.” \n   \n","As Hannah kept on praying before the LORD, Eli watched her mouth. \n","Hannah was praying in her heart, and though her lips were moving, her voice could not be heard. \n  So Eli thought she was drunk \n","and said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine!” \n   \n","“No, my lord,” Hannah replied. “I am a woman oppressed in spirit. I have not had any wine or strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD. \n","Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; for all this time I have been praying out of the depth of my anguish and grief.” \n   \n","“Go in peace,” Eli replied, “and may the God of Israel grant the petition you have asked of Him.” \n   \n","“May your maidservant find favor with you,” said Hannah. Then she went on her way, and she began eating again, and her face was no longer downcast. \n   \n","The next morning Elkanah and Hannah got up early to bow in worship before the LORD, and then returned home to Ramah. \n  And Elkanah had relations with his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her. \n","So in the course of time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked for him from the LORD.” \n   \n","Then Elkanah and all his house went up to make the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow, \n","but Hannah did not go. “After the boy is weaned,” she said to her husband, “I will take him to appear before the LORD and to stay there permanently.” \n   \n","“Do what you think is best,” her husband Elkanah replied, “and stay here until you have weaned him. Only may the LORD confirm His word.” \n  So Hannah stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him. \n   \n","Once she had weaned him, Hannah took the boy with her, along with a three-year-old bull,  an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. Though the boy was still young, she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. \n","And when they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli. \n   \n","“Please, my lord,” said Hannah, “as surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD. \n","I prayed for this boy, and since the LORD has granted me what I asked of Him, \n","I now dedicate the boy to the LORD. For as long as he lives, he is dedicated to the LORD.” \n  So they worshiped  the LORD there. \n"],["At that time Hannah prayed: \n  “My heart rejoices in the LORD \n in whom my horn  is exalted. \n My mouth speaks boldly against my enemies, \n for I rejoice in Your salvation. \n  \n","There is no one holy like the LORD. \n Indeed, there is no one besides You! \n And there is no Rock like our God. \n   \n","Do not boast so proudly, \n or let arrogance come from your mouth, \n for the LORD is a God who knows, \n and by Him actions are weighed. \n   \n","The bows of the mighty are broken, \n but the feeble are equipped with strength. \n  \n","The well-fed hire themselves out for food, \n but the starving hunger no more. \n The barren woman gives birth to seven, \n but she who has many sons pines away. \n   \n","The LORD brings death and gives life; \n He brings down to Sheol and raises up. \n  \n","The LORD sends poverty and wealth; \n He humbles and He exalts. \n  \n","He raises the poor from the dust \n and lifts the needy from the ash heap. \n He seats them among princes \n and bestows on them a throne of honor. \n  For the foundations of the earth are the LORD’s, \n and upon them He has set the world. \n  \n","He guards the steps of His faithful ones, \n but the wicked perish in darkness; \n for by his own strength shall no man prevail. \n   \n","Those who oppose the LORD will be shattered. \n He will thunder from heaven against them. \n The LORD will judge the ends of the earth \n and will give power to His king. \n He will exalt the horn of His anointed.” \n   \n","Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy began ministering to the LORD before Eli the priest. \n   \n","Now the sons of Eli were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD \n","or for the custom of the priests with the people. \n  When any man offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged meat fork while the meat was boiling \n","and plunge it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or cooking pot. And the priest would claim for himself whatever the meat fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. \n   \n","Even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast, because he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.” \n   \n","And if any man said to him, “The fat must be burned first; then you may take whatever you want,” the servant would reply, “No, you must give it to me right now. If you refuse, I will take it by force!” \n   \n","Thus the sin of these young men was severe in the sight of the LORD, for they  were treating the LORD’s offering with contempt. \n   \n","Now Samuel was ministering before the LORD—a boy wearing a linen ephod. \n","Each year his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him when she went with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. \n","And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May the LORD give you children by this woman in place of the one she dedicated to the LORD. ” Then they would go home. \n   \n","So the LORD attended to Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. \n  Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD. \n   \n","Now Eli was very old, and he heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. \n   \n","“Why are you doing these things?” Eli said to his sons. “I hear about your wicked deeds from all these people. \n","No, my sons; it is not a good report I hear circulating among the LORD’s people. \n","If a man sins against another man, God  can intercede for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?” \n  But they would not listen to their father, since the LORD intended to put them to death. \n   \n","And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with man. \n   \n","Then a man of God came to Eli and told him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Did I not clearly reveal Myself to your father’s house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh’s house? \n","And out of all the tribes of Israel I selected your father to be My priest, to offer sacrifices on My altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in My presence. I also gave to the house of your father all the offerings of the Israelites made by fire. \n   \n","Why then do you kick at  My sacrifice and offering that I have prescribed for My dwelling place? You have honored your sons more than Me by fattening yourselves with the best of all the offerings of My people Israel.’ \n   \n","Therefore, the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: \n  ‘I did indeed say that your house \n and the house of your father \n would walk before Me forever. \n  But now the LORD declares: \n Far be it from Me! \n For I will honor those who honor Me, \n but those who despise Me will be disdained. \n   \n","Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so that no older man will be left in your house. \n","You will see distress in My dwelling place. Despite all that is good in Israel, no one in your house will ever again reach old age. \n","And every one of you that I do not cut off from My altar, your eyes will fail and your heart will grieve.  All your descendants   will die by the sword of men. \n   \n","And this sign shall come to you concerning your two sons Hophni and Phinehas: They will both die on the same day. \n   \n","Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest. He will do whatever is in My heart and mind. And I will build for him an enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed one for all time. \n   \n","And everyone left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a morsel of bread, pleading, “Please appoint me to some priestly office so that I can eat a piece of bread.”’” \n"],["And the boy Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. \n  Now in those days the word of the LORD was rare and visions were scarce. \n","And at that time Eli, whose eyesight had grown so dim that he could not see, was lying in his room. \n   \n","Before the lamp of God had gone out, Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was located. \n   \n","Then the LORD called to Samuel, and he answered, “Here I am.” \n   \n","He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” \n  “I did not call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.” \n  So he went and lay down. \n   \n","Once again the LORD called, “Samuel!” \n  So Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” \n  “My son, I did not call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.” \n   \n","Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, because the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him. \n","Once again, for the third time, the LORD called to Samuel. He got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” \n  Then Eli realized that it was the LORD who was calling the boy. \n","“Go and lie down,” he said to Samuel, “and if He calls you, say, ‘Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.’” \n  So Samuel went and lay down in his place. \n   \n","Then the LORD came and stood there, calling as before, “Samuel! Samuel!” \n  And Samuel answered, “Speak, for Your servant is listening.” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Samuel, “I am about to do something in Israel at which the ears of all who hear it will tingle. \n","On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I have spoken about his family, from beginning to end. \n","I told him that I would judge his house forever for the iniquity of which he knows, because his sons blasphemed God  and he did not restrain them. \n","Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, ‘The iniquity of Eli’s house shall never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’” \n   \n","Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, \n","but Eli called to him and said, “Samuel, my son.” \n  “Here I am,” answered Samuel. \n   \n","“What was the message He gave you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide it from me. May God punish you, and ever so severely, if you hide from me anything He said to you.” \n   \n","So Samuel told him everything and did not hide a thing from him. \n  “He is the LORD,” replied Eli. “Let Him do what is good in His eyes.” \n   \n","And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and He let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground. \n   \n","So all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD. \n","And the LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, because there He revealed Himself to Samuel by His word. \n"],["Thus the word of Samuel came to all Israel. \n  Now the Israelites went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped at Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped at Aphek. \n","The Philistines arrayed themselves against Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who struck down about four thousand men on the battlefield. \n   \n","When the troops returned to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why has the LORD brought defeat on us before the Philistines today? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh, so that it may go  with us to save us from the hand of our enemies.” \n   \n","So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the LORD of Hosts, who sits enthroned between the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. \n   \n","When the ark of the covenant of the LORD entered the camp, all the Israelites raised such a great shout that it shook the ground. \n   \n","On hearing the noise of the shout, the Philistines asked, “What is this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?” \n  And when they realized that the ark of the LORD had entered the camp, \n","the Philistines were afraid. “The gods have entered  their camp!” they said. “Woe to us, for nothing like this has happened before. \n","Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. \n","Take courage and be men, O Philistines! Otherwise, you will serve the Hebrews just as they served you. Now be men and fight!” \n   \n","So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great—thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell. \n","The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died. \n   \n","That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line all the way to Shiloh, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. \n","When he arrived, there was Eli, sitting on his chair beside the road and watching, because his heart trembled for the ark of God. \n  When the man entered the city to give a report, the whole city cried out. \n   \n","Eli heard the outcry and asked, “Why this commotion?” \n  So the man hurried over and reported to Eli. \n","Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his gaze was fixed because he could not see. \n   \n","“I have just come from the battle,” the man said to Eli. “I fled from there today.” \n  “What happened, my son?” Eli asked. \n   \n","The messenger answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are both dead, and the ark of God has been captured.” \n   \n","As soon as the ark of God was mentioned, Eli fell backward from his chair by the city gate, and being old and heavy, he broke his neck and died. And Eli had judged  Israel forty years. \n   \n","Now Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and about to give birth. When she heard the news of the capture of God’s ark and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband, she collapsed and gave birth, for her labor pains overtook her. \n   \n","As she was dying, the women attending to her said, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son!” \n  But she did not respond or pay any heed. \n","And she named the boy Ichabod,  saying, “The glory has departed  from Israel,” because the ark of God had been captured and her father-in-law and her husband had been killed. \n   \n","“The glory has departed from Israel,” she said, “for the ark of God has been captured.” \n"],["After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod, \n","carried it into the temple of Dagon, and set it beside his statue. \n   \n","When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on his face before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and returned him to his place. \n   \n","But when they got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on his face before the ark of the LORD, with his head and his hands broken off and lying on the threshold. Only the torso remained. \n","That is why, to this day, the priests of Dagon and all who enter the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on the threshold. \n   \n","Now the hand of the LORD was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity, ravaging them and afflicting them with tumors. \n","And when the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not stay here with us, because His hand is heavy upon us and upon our god Dagon.” \n   \n","So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” \n  “It must be moved to Gath,” they replied. So they carried away the ark of the God of Israel. \n   \n","But after they had moved the ark to Gath, the LORD’s hand was also against that city, throwing it into great confusion and afflicting the men of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors. \n   \n","So they sent the ark of God to Ekron, but as it arrived, the Ekronites cried out, “They have brought us the ark of the God of Israel in order to kill us and our people!” \n   \n","Then the Ekronites assembled all the rulers of the Philistines and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel. It must return to its place, so that it will not  kill us and our people!” \n  For a deadly confusion had pervaded the city; the hand of God was heavy upon it. \n","Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven. \n"],["When the ark of the LORD had been in the land of the Philistines seven months, \n","the Philistines summoned the priests and diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how to send it back to its place.” \n   \n","They replied, “If you return the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it away empty, but by all means return it to Him with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why His hand has not been lifted from you.” \n   \n","“What guilt offering should we send back to Him?” asked the Philistines. \n  “Five gold tumors and five gold rats,” they said, “according to the number of rulers of the Philistines, since the same plague has struck both you and your rulers. \n","Make images of your tumors and of the rats that are ravaging the land. Give glory to the God of Israel, and perhaps He will lift His hand from you and your gods and your land. \n   \n","Why harden  your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs? When He afflicted them, did they not send the people on their way as they departed? \n   \n","Now, therefore, prepare one new cart with two milk cows that have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up. \n","Take the ark of the LORD, set it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending Him as a guilt offering. \n  Then send the ark on its way, \n","but keep watching it. If it goes up the road to its homeland, toward Beth-shemesh, it is the LORD who has brought on us this great disaster. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not His hand that punished us and that it happened by chance.” \n   \n","So the men did as instructed. They took two milk cows, hitched them to the cart, and penned up their calves. \n","Then they put the ark of the LORD on the cart, along with the chest containing the gold rats and the images of the tumors. \n   \n","And the cows headed straight up the road toward Beth-shemesh, staying on that one highway and lowing as they went, never straying to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed behind them to the border of Beth-shemesh. \n   \n","Now the people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they were overjoyed at the sight. \n   \n","The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there near a large rock. The people chopped up the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. \n","And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the chest containing the gold objects, and they placed them on the large rock. That day the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the LORD. \n   \n","And when the five rulers of the Philistines saw this, they returned to Ekron that same day. \n   \n","As a guilt offering to the LORD, the Philistines had sent back one gold tumor for each city: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. \n","The number of gold rats also corresponded to the number of Philistine cities belonging to the five rulers—the fortified cities and their outlying villages. And the large rock  on which they placed the ark of the LORD stands to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh. \n   \n","But God struck down some of the people of Beth-shemesh because they looked inside the ark of the LORD. He struck down seventy men, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck them with a great slaughter. \n   \n","The men of Beth-shemesh asked, “Who can stand in the presence of the LORD, this holy God? To whom should the ark go up from here?” \n   \n","So they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up with you.” \n"],["Then the men of Kiriath-jearim came for the ark of the LORD and took it into Abinadab’s house on the hill. And they consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of the LORD. \n   \n","And from that day a long time passed, twenty years in all, as the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim. And all the house of Israel mourned and sought after the LORD. \n   \n","Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, “If you are returning to the LORD with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and Ashtoreths among you, prepare your hearts for the LORD, and serve Him only. And He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.” \n   \n","So the Israelites put away the Baals and Ashtoreths and served only the LORD. \n   \n","Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD on your behalf.” \n   \n","When they had gathered at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the LORD. On that day they fasted, and there they confessed, “We have sinned against the LORD.” And Samuel judged  the Israelites at Mizpah. \n   \n","When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, their rulers marched up toward Israel. And when the Israelites learned of this, they feared the Philistines \n","and said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.” \n   \n","Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. He cried out to the LORD on behalf of Israel, and the LORD answered him. \n","As the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel, Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering. But that day the LORD thundered loudly against the Philistines and threw them into such confusion that they fled before Israel. \n   \n","Then the men of Israel charged out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, striking them down all the way to an area below Beth-car. \n   \n","Afterward, Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen.  He named it Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far the LORD has helped us.” \n   \n","So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped invading the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. \n","The cities from Ekron to Gath, which the Philistines had taken, were restored to Israel, who also delivered the surrounding territory from the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between the Israelites and the Amorites. \n   \n","So Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. \n","Every year he would go on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all these places. \n","Then he would return to Ramah because his home was there, and there he judged Israel and built an altar to the LORD. \n"],["When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges  over Israel. \n","The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba. \n","But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside toward dishonest gain, accepting bribes and perverting justice. \n   \n","So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. \n","“Look,” they said, “you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint a king to judge us like all the other nations.” \n   \n","But when they said, “Give us a king to judge us,” their demand was displeasing in the sight of Samuel; so he prayed to the LORD. \n   \n","And the LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you. For it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected Me as their king. \n","Just as they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking Me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you. \n","Now listen to them, but you must solemnly warn them and show them the manner of the king who will reign over them.” \n   \n","So Samuel spoke all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king. \n","He said, “This will be the manner of the king who will reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them to his own chariots and horses, to run in front of his chariots. \n   \n","He will appoint some for himself as commanders of thousands and of fifties, and others to plow his ground, to reap his harvest, to make his weapons of war, and to equip his chariots. \n   \n","And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers. \n   \n","He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his servants. \n","He will take a tenth of your grain and grape harvest and give it to his officials and servants. \n","And he will take your menservants and maidservants and your best cattle  and donkeys and put them to his own use. \n   \n","He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves. \n","When that day comes, you will beg for relief from the king you have chosen, but the LORD will not answer you on that day.” \n   \n","Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We must have a king over us. \n","Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to judge us, to go out before us, and to fight our battles.” \n   \n","Samuel listened to all the words of the people and repeated them in the hearing of the LORD. \n   \n","“Listen to their voice,” the LORD said to Samuel. “Appoint a king for them.” \n  Then Samuel told the men of Israel, “Everyone must go back to his city.” \n"],["Now there was a Benjamite, a powerful man, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. \n","And he had a son named Saul, choice and handsome, without equal among the Israelites—a head taller than any of the people. \n   \n","One day the donkeys of Saul’s father Kish wandered off, and Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants and go look for the donkeys.” \n   \n","So Saul passed through the hill country of Ephraim and then through the land of Shalishah, but did not find the donkeys. He and the servant went through the region of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then they went through the land of Benjamin, and still they did not find them. \n   \n","When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, “Come, let us go back, or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us.” \n   \n","“Look,” said the servant, “in this city there is a man of God who is highly respected; everything he says surely comes to pass. Let us go there now. Perhaps he will tell us which way to go.” \n   \n","“If we do go,” Saul replied, “what can we give the man? For the bread in our packs is gone, and there is no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?” \n   \n","The servant answered him again. “Look,” he said, “I have here in my hand a quarter shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God, and he will tell us our way.” \n   \n","(Formerly in Israel, a man on his way to inquire of God would say, “Come, let us go to the seer.” For the prophet of today was formerly called the seer.) \n   \n","“Good,” said Saul to his servant. “Come, let us go.” So they set out for the city where the man of God was. \n","And as they were climbing the hill to the city, they met some young women coming out to draw water and asked, “Is the seer here?” \n   \n","“Yes, he is ahead of you,” they answered. “Hurry now, for today he has come to the city because the people have a sacrifice on the high place. \n","As soon as you enter the city, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; after that, the guests will eat. Go up at once; you will find him.” \n   \n","So Saul and his servant went up toward the city, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel coming toward them on his way up to the high place. \n   \n","Now on the day before Saul’s arrival, the LORD had revealed to Samuel, \n","“At this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you are to anoint him leader over My people Israel; he will save them from the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked upon My people, because their cry has come to Me.” \n   \n","When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, “Here is the man of whom I spoke; he shall rule over My people.” \n   \n","Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?” \n   \n","“I am the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today. And when I send you off in the morning, I will tell you all that is in your heart. \n","As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them, for they have been found. And upon whom is all the desire of Israel, if not upon you and all your father’s house?” \n   \n","Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjamite from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of Benjamin? So why would you say such a thing to me?” \n   \n","Then Samuel took Saul and his servant, brought them into the hall, and seated them in the place of honor among those who were invited—about thirty in all. \n","And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you and told you to set aside.” \n   \n","So the cook picked up the leg and what was attached to it and set it before Saul. Then Samuel said, “Here is what was kept back. It was set apart for you. Eat, for it has been kept for you for this occasion, from the time I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul dined with Samuel that day. \n   \n","And after they had come down from the high place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof of his house. \n   \n","They got up early in the morning, and just before dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I will send you on your way!” So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went outside together. \n   \n","As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay for a while, and I will reveal to you the word of God.” So the servant went on. \n"],["Then Samuel took a flask of oil, poured it on Saul’s head, kissed him, and said, “Has not the LORD anointed you ruler over His inheritance? \n","When you leave me today, you will find two men at Rachel’s tomb in Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you seek have been found, and now your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and started worrying about you, asking, “What should I do about my son?”’ \n   \n","Then you will go on from there until you come to the Oak  of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. \n","They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from their hands. \n   \n","After that you will come to Gibeah of God, where the Philistines have an outpost. As you approach the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place, preceded by harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres, and they will be prophesying. \n   \n","Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be transformed into a different person. \n   \n","When these signs have come, do as the occasion demands, for God is with you. \n","And you shall go before me to Gilgal, and surely I will come to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you are to do.” \n   \n","As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s heart, and all the signs came to pass that day. \n","When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. Then the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied along with them. \n   \n","All those who had formerly known Saul and saw him prophesying with the prophets asked one another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” \n   \n","Then a man who lived there replied, “And who is their father?” So the saying became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” \n   \n","And when Saul had finished prophesying, he went up to the high place. \n   \n","Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where did you go?” \n  “To look for the donkeys,” Saul replied. “When we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.” \n   \n","“Tell me,” Saul’s uncle asked, “what did Samuel say to you?” \n   \n","And Saul replied, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But Saul did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship. \n   \n","After this, Samuel summoned the people to the LORD at Mizpah \n","and said to the Israelites, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I rescued you from the hands of the Egyptians and of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’ \n   \n","But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your troubles and afflictions, and you have said to Him, ‘No, set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans.” \n   \n","Thus Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected. \n","Then he had the tribe of Benjamin come forward by its clans, and the clan of Matri was selected. Finally, Saul son of Kish was selected. But when they looked for him, they could not find him. \n","So again they inquired of the LORD, “Has the man come here yet?” \n  And the LORD replied, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.” \n   \n","So they ran and brought Saul, and when he stood among the people, he was a head taller than any of the others. \n","Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the one the LORD has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.” \n  And all the people shouted, “Long live the king!” \n   \n","Then Samuel explained to the people the rights of kingship. He wrote them on a scroll and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, each to his own home. \n   \n","Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, and the men of valor whose hearts God had touched went with him. \n   \n","But some worthless men said, “How can this man save us?” So they despised him and brought him no gifts; but Saul remained silent about it. \n"],["Soon Nahash   the Ammonite came up and laid siege to Jabesh-gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to him, “Make a treaty  with us, and we will serve you.” \n   \n","But Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will make a treaty with you on one condition, that I may put out everyone’s right eye and bring reproach upon all Israel.” \n   \n","“Hold off for seven days,” replied the elders of Jabesh, “and let us send messengers throughout Israel. If there is no one to save us, we will surrender to you.” \n   \n","When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and relayed these words in the hearing of the people, they all wept aloud. \n   \n","Just then Saul was returning from the field, behind his oxen. “What troubles the people?” asked Saul. “Why are they weeping?” And they relayed to him the words of the men from Jabesh. \n   \n","When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he burned with great anger. \n","He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent them by messengers throughout the land of Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not march behind Saul and Samuel.” \n  Then the terror of the LORD fell upon the people, and they turned out as one man. \n","And when Saul numbered them at Bezek, there were 300,000 Israelites and 30,000  men of Judah. \n","So they said to the messengers who had come, “Tell the men of Jabesh-gilead: ‘Deliverance will be yours tomorrow by the time the sun is hot.’” \n  And when the messengers relayed this to the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced. \n   \n","Then the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Tomorrow we will come out, and you can do with us whatever seems good to you.” \n   \n","The next day Saul organized the troops into three divisions, and during the morning watch they invaded the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them, until the hottest part of the day. And the survivors were so scattered that no two of them were left together. \n   \n","Then the people said to Samuel, “Who said that Saul should not reign over us? Bring those men here so we can kill them!” \n   \n","But Saul ordered, “No one shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has worked salvation in Israel.” \n   \n","Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingship there.” \n   \n","So all the people went to Gilgal and confirmed Saul as king in the presence of the LORD. There they sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD, and Saul and all the Israelites rejoiced greatly. \n"],["Then Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to your voice in all that you have said to me, and I have set over you a king. \n","Now here is the king walking before you, and I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you.

Tell me, and I will restore it  to you.” \n   \n","“You have not wronged us or oppressed us,” they replied, “nor have you taken anything from the hand of man.” \n   \n","Samuel said to them, “The LORD is a witness against you, and His anointed is a witness today, that you have not found anything in my hand.” \n  “He is a witness,” they replied. \n   \n","Then Samuel said to the people, “The LORD is the One who  appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. \n","Now present yourselves, so that I may confront you before the LORD with all the righteous acts He has done for you and your fathers. \n   \n","When Jacob went to Egypt, your fathers cried out to the LORD, and He sent them Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place. \n","But they forgot the LORD their God, and He sold them into the hand of Sisera the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them. \n   \n","Then they cried out to the LORD and said, ‘We have sinned, for we have forsaken the LORD and served the Baals and Ashtoreths. Now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, that we may serve You.’ \n   \n","So the LORD sent Jerubbaal,  Barak,  Jephthah, and Samuel, and He delivered you from the hands of your enemies on every side, and you dwelt securely. \n","But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, ‘No, we must have a king to rule over us’—even though the LORD your God was your king. \n   \n","Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you requested. Behold, the LORD has placed a king over you. \n   \n","If you fear the LORD and serve Him and obey His voice, and if you do not rebel against the command of the LORD, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the LORD your God, then all will be well. \n","But if you disobey the LORD and rebel against His command, then the hand of the LORD will be against you as it was against your fathers. \n   \n","Now, therefore, stand and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes. \n","Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call on the LORD to send thunder and rain, so that you will know and see what a great evil you have committed in the sight of the LORD by asking for a king.” \n   \n","So Samuel called to the LORD, and on that day the LORD sent thunder and rain. \n  As a result, all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. \n","They pleaded with Samuel, “Pray to the LORD your God for your servants so that we will not die!

And the rest of the troops he sent away, each to his own home. \n   \n","Then Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. So Saul blew the ram’s horn throughout the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!” \n   \n","And all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked an outpost of the Philistines, and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines!” Then the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal. \n   \n","Now the Philistines assembled to fight against Israel with three thousand  chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven. \n   \n","Seeing that they were in danger because their troops were hard-pressed, the men of Israel hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in cellars and cisterns. \n","Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul, however, remained at Gilgal, and all his troops were quaking in fear. \n   \n","And Saul waited seven days for the time appointed by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the troops began to desert Saul. \n","So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered up the burnt offering. \n   \n","Just as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him. \n   \n","“What have you done?” Samuel asked. \n  And Saul replied, “When I saw that the troops were deserting me, and that you did not come at the appointed time and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash, \n","I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will descend upon me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.” \n   \n","“You have acted foolishly,” Samuel declared. “You have not kept the command that the LORD your God gave you; if you had, the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. \n","But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought a man after His own heart and appointed him ruler over His people, because you have not kept the command of the LORD.” \n   \n","Then Samuel set out from Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin. And Saul numbered the troops who were with him, about six hundred men. \n   \n","Now Saul and Jonathan his son and the troops with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Michmash. \n","And raiders went out of the Philistine camp in three divisions. One headed toward Ophrah in the land of Shual, \n","another toward Beth-horon, and the third down the border road overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the wilderness. \n   \n","And no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “The Hebrews must not be allowed to make swords or spears.” \n","Instead, all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles. \n","The charge was a pim   for sharpening a plowshare or mattock, a third of a shekel for sharpening a pitchfork or an axe, and a third of a shekel for repointing an oxgoad. \n   \n","So on the day of battle not a sword or spear could be found in the hands of the troops with Saul and Jonathan; only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons. \n   \n","And a garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Michmash. \n"],["One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor, “Come, let us cross over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.” But Jonathan did not tell his father. \n   \n","Meanwhile, Saul was staying under the pomegranate tree  in Migron on the outskirts of Gibeah. And the troops who were with him numbered about six hundred men, \n","including Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was the son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of the LORD in Shiloh. But the troops did not know that Jonathan had left. \n   \n","Now there were cliffs on both sides of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost. One was named Bozez and the other Seneh. \n","One cliff stood to the north toward Michmash, and the other to the south toward Geba. \n   \n","Jonathan said to the young man bearing his armor, “Come, let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the LORD will work on our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.” \n   \n","His armor-bearer replied, “Do all that is in your heart. Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.” \n   \n","“Very well,” said Jonathan, “we will cross over toward these men and show ourselves to them. \n","If they say, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stay where we are and will not go up to them. \n","But if they say, ‘Come on up,’ then we will go up, because this will be our sign that the LORD has delivered them into our hands.” \n   \n","So the two of them showed themselves to the outpost of the Philistines, who exclaimed, “Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes in which they were hiding!” \n   \n","So the men of the outpost called out to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come on up, and we will teach you a lesson!” \n  “Follow me,” Jonathan told his armor-bearer, “for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel.” \n   \n","So Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer behind him. And the Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and finished them off. \n","In that first assault, Jonathan and his armor-bearer struck down about twenty men over half an acre  of land. \n   \n","Then terror struck the Philistines in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. Even those in the outposts and raiding parties trembled. Indeed, the earth quaked and panic spread from God. \n   \n","Now when Saul’s watchmen at Gibeah in Benjamin looked and saw the troops melting away and scattering in every direction, \n","Saul said to the troops who were with him, “Call the roll and see who has left us.” \n  And when they had called the roll, they saw that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. \n   \n","Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God.” (For at that time it was with the Israelites.) \n","While Saul was talking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp continued to increase. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.” \n   \n","Then Saul and all his troops assembled and marched to the battle, and they found the Philistines in total confusion, with each man wielding the sword against his neighbor. \n","And the Hebrews who had previously gone up into the surrounding camps of the Philistines now went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. \n","When all the Israelites who had been hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also joined Saul and Jonathan in the battle. \n   \n","So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth-aven. \n   \n","Now the men of Israel were in distress that day, for Saul had placed the troops under an oath, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food before evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.” So none of the troops tasted any food. \n   \n","Then all the troops entered the forest, and there was honey on the ground. \n","And when they entered the forest and saw the flowing honey, not one of them put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath. \n   \n","Jonathan, however, had not heard that his father had charged the people with the oath. So he reached out the end of the staff in his hand, dipped it into the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened. \n","Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your father bound the troops with a solemn oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’ That is why the people are faint.” \n   \n","“My father has brought trouble to the land,” Jonathan replied. “Just look at how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. \n","How much better it would have been if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder they took from their enemies! Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been much greater?” \n   \n","That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, the people were very faint. \n","So they rushed greedily to the plunder, taking sheep, cattle, and calves. They slaughtered them on the ground and ate meat with the blood still in it. \n   \n","Then someone reported to Saul: “Look, the troops are sinning against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.” \n  “You have broken faith,” said Saul. “Roll a large stone over here at once.” \n","Then he said, “Go among the troops and tell them, ‘Each man must bring me his ox or his sheep, slaughter them in this place, and then eat. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.’” \n  So that night everyone brought his ox and slaughtered it there. \n","Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had built an altar to the LORD. \n   \n","And Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until dawn, leaving no man alive!” \n  “Do what seems good to you,” the troops replied. \n  But the priest said, “We must consult God here.” \n   \n","So Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You give them into the hand of Israel?” \n  But God did not answer him that day. \n   \n","Therefore Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the troops, and let us investigate how this sin has occurred today. \n","As surely as the LORD who saves Israel lives, even if it is my son Jonathan, he must die!” \n  But not one of the troops said a word. \n   \n","Then Saul said to all Israel, “You stand on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side.” \n  “Do what seems good to you,” the troops replied. \n   \n","So Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, “Why have You not answered Your servant this day? If the fault is with me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim; but if the fault is with the men of Israel, respond with Thummim.” And Jonathan and Saul were selected, but the people were cleared of the charge. \n   \n","Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was selected. \n   \n","“Tell me what you have done,” Saul commanded him. \n  So Jonathan told him, “I only tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. And now I must die?” \n   \n","And Saul declared, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if you, Jonathan, do not surely die!” \n   \n","But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die—he who accomplished such a great deliverance for Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for with God’s help he has accomplished this today.” \n  So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die. \n","Then Saul gave up his pursuit of the Philistines, and the Philistines returned to their own land. \n   \n","After Saul had assumed the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side—the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, the kings   of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he routed them. \n","He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of its plunderers. \n   \n","Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. His two daughters were named Merab (his firstborn) and Michal (his younger daughter). \n","His wife’s name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner, the son of Saul’s uncle Ner. \n","Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel. \n   \n","And the war with the Philistines was fierce for all the days of Saul. So whenever he noticed any strong or brave man, Saul would enlist him. \n"],["Then Samuel said to Saul, “The LORD sent me to anoint you king over His people Israel. Now therefore, listen to the words of the LORD. \n","This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘I witnessed what the Amalekites did to the Israelites when they ambushed them on their way up from Egypt. \n","Now go and attack the Amalekites and devote to destruction  all that belongs to them. Do not spare them, but put to death men and women, children and infants, oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.’” \n   \n","So Saul summoned the troops and numbered them at Telaim—200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. \n","Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley. \n","And he warned the Kenites, “Since you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt, go on and get away from the Amalekites. Otherwise I will sweep you away with them.” \n  So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites. \n   \n","Then Saul struck down the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt. \n","He captured Agag king of Amalek alive, but devoted all the others to destruction with the sword. \n   \n","Saul and his troops spared Agag, along with the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves  and lambs, and the best of everything else. They were unwilling to destroy them, but they devoted to destruction all that was despised and worthless. \n   \n","Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying, \n","“I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from following Me and has not carried out My instructions.” \n  And Samuel was distressed and cried out to the LORD all that night. \n   \n","Early in the morning Samuel got up to confront Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel, and behold, he has set up a monument for himself and has turned and gone down to Gilgal.” \n   \n","When Samuel reached him, Saul said to him, “May the LORD bless you. I have carried out the LORD’s instructions.” \n   \n","But Samuel replied, “Then what is this bleating of sheep and lowing of cattle that I hear?” \n   \n","Saul answered, “The troops brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but the rest we devoted to destruction.” \n   \n","“Stop!” exclaimed Samuel. “Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night.” \n  “Tell me,” Saul replied. \n   \n","And Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, have you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel \n","and sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and devote to destruction the sinful Amalekites. Fight against them until you have wiped them out.’ \n","So why did you not obey the LORD? Why did you rush upon the plunder and do evil in the sight of the LORD?” \n   \n","“But I did obey the LORD,” Saul replied. “I went on the mission that the LORD gave me. I brought back Agag king of Amalek and devoted the Amalekites to destruction. \n","The troops took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of the things devoted to destruction, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal.” \n   \n","But Samuel declared: \n  “Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices \n as much as in obedience to His voice? \n Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice, \n and attentiveness is better than the fat of rams. \n  \n","For rebellion is like the sin of divination, \n and arrogance is like the wickedness of idolatry. \n Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, \n He has rejected you as king.” \n   \n","Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; I have transgressed the LORD’s commandment and your instructions, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice. \n","Now therefore, please forgive my sin and return with me so I can worship the LORD.” \n   \n","“I will not return with you,” Samuel replied. “For you have rejected the word of the LORD, and He has rejected you as king over Israel.” \n   \n","As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the hem of his robe, and it tore. \n","So Samuel said to him, “The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor who is better than you. \n","Moreover, the Glory of Israel does not lie or change His mind, for He is not a man, that He should change His mind.” \n   \n","“I have sinned,” Saul replied. “Please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel. Come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God.” \n   \n","So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD. \n   \n","Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.” \n  Agag came to him cheerfully,  for he thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.” \n   \n","But Samuel declared: \n  “As your sword has made women childless, \n so your mother will be childless among women.” \n  And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal. \n   \n","Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. \n","And to the day of his death, Samuel never again visited Saul. Samuel mourned for Saul, and the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel. \n"],["Now the LORD said to Samuel, “How long are you going to mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem, for I have selected from his sons a king for Myself.” \n   \n","“How can I go?” Samuel asked. “Saul will hear of it and kill me!” \n  The LORD answered, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’ \n","Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you are to do. You are to anoint for Me the one I indicate.” \n   \n","So Samuel did what the LORD had said and went to Bethlehem. When the elders of the town met him, they trembled and asked, “Do you come in peace?” \n   \n","“In peace,” he replied. “I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” \n  Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. \n","When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and said, “Surely here before the LORD is His anointed.” \n   \n","But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or height, for I have rejected him; the LORD does not see as man does. For man sees the outward appearance, but the LORD sees the heart.” \n   \n","Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel, who said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.” \n   \n","Next Jesse presented Shammah, but Samuel said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.” \n   \n","Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel told him, “The LORD has not chosen any of these.” \n   \n","And Samuel asked him, “Are these all the sons you have?” \n  “There is still the youngest,” Jesse replied, “but he is tending the sheep.” \n  “Send for him,” Samuel replied. “For we will not sit down to eat until he arrives.” \n   \n","So Jesse sent for his youngest son and brought him in. He was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And the LORD said, “Rise and anoint him, for he is the one.” \n   \n","So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. Then Samuel set out and went to Ramah. \n   \n","After the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, a spirit of distress  from the LORD began to torment him. \n","Saul’s servants said to him, “Surely a spirit of distress from God is tormenting you. \n","Let our lord command your servants here to seek out someone who can skillfully play the harp. Whenever the spirit of distress from God is upon you, he is to play it, and you will be well.” \n   \n","And Saul commanded his servants, “Find me someone who plays well, and bring him to me.” \n   \n","One of the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the harp. He is a mighty man of valor, a warrior, eloquent and handsome, and the LORD is with him.” \n   \n","So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.” \n   \n","And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and one young goat, and sent them to Saul with his son David. \n","When David came to Saul and entered his service, Saul admired him greatly, and David became his armor-bearer. \n   \n","Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Let David remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.” \n","And whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would pick up his harp and play, and Saul would become well, and the spirit of distress would depart from him. \n"],["Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war at Socoh in Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim. \n","Saul and the men of Israel assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah, arraying themselves for battle against the Philistines. \n   \n","The Philistines stood on one hill and the Israelites stood on another, with the valley between them. \n   \n","Then a champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out from the Philistine camp. He was six cubits and a span in height, \n","and he had a bronze helmet on his head. He wore a bronze coat of mail weighing five thousand shekels, \n","and he had armor of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. \n","The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. In addition, his shield bearer went before him. \n   \n","And Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and array yourselves for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose one of your men and have him come down against me. \n","If he is able to fight me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and labor for us.” \n   \n","Then the Philistine said, “I defy the ranks of Israel this day! Give me a man to fight!” \n   \n","On hearing the words of the Philistine, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and greatly afraid. \n   \n","Now David was the son of a man named Jesse, an Ephrathite from Bethlehem of Judah who had eight sons in the days of Saul. And Jesse was old and well along in years. \n","The three older sons of Jesse had followed Saul into battle: The firstborn was Eliab, the second was Abinadab, and the third was Shammah. \n","And David was the youngest. \n  The three oldest had followed Saul, \n","but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep in Bethlehem. \n   \n","For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening to take his stand. \n   \n","One day Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah of roasted grain  and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. \n","Take also these ten portions of cheese to the commander of their unit. Check on the welfare of your brothers and bring back an assurance from them. \n","They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.” \n   \n","So David got up early in the morning, left the flock with a keeper, loaded up, and set out as Jesse had instructed him. He reached the camp as the army was marching out to its position and shouting the battle cry. \n","And Israel and the Philistines arrayed in formation against each other. \n   \n","Then David left his supplies in the care of the quartermaster and ran to the battle line. When he arrived, he asked his brothers how they were doing. \n","And as he was speaking with them, suddenly the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, came forward from the Philistines and shouted his usual words, which David also heard. \n   \n","When all the men of Israel saw Goliath, they fled from him in great fear. \n   \n","Now the men of Israel had been saying, “Do you see this man who keeps coming out to defy Israel? To the man who kills him the king will give great riches. And he will give him his daughter in marriage and exempt his father’s house from taxation in Israel.” \n   \n","David asked the men who were standing with him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Just who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” \n   \n","The people told him about the offer, saying, “That is what will be done for the man who kills him.” \n   \n","Now when David’s oldest brother Eliab heard him speaking to the men, his anger burned against David. “Why have you come down here?” he asked. “And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and wickedness of heart—you have come down to see the battle!” \n   \n","“What have I done now?” said David. “Was it not just a question?” \n","Then he turned from him toward another and asked about the offer, and those people answered him just as the first ones had answered. \n   \n","Now David’s words were overheard and reported to Saul, who called for him. \n   \n","And David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail on account of this Philistine. Your servant will go and fight him!” \n   \n","But Saul replied, “You cannot go out against this Philistine to fight him. You are just a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth.” \n   \n","David replied, “Your servant has been tending his father’s sheep, and whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock, \n","I went after it, struck it down, and delivered the lamb from its mouth. If it reared up against me, I would grab it by its fur, strike it down, and kill it. \n","Your servant has killed lions and bears; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.” \n   \n","David added, “The LORD, who delivered me from the claws of the lion and the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” \n  “Go,” said Saul, “and may the LORD be with you.” \n   \n","Then Saul clothed David in his own tunic, put a bronze helmet on his head, and dressed him in armor. \n","David strapped his sword over the tunic and tried to walk, but he was not accustomed to them. \n  “I cannot walk in these,” David said to Saul. “I am not accustomed to them.” So David took them off. \n","And David took his staff in his hand, selected five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag. And with his sling in hand, he approached the Philistine. \n   \n","Now the Philistine came closer and closer to David, with his shield-bearer before him. \n","When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him because he was just a boy, ruddy and handsome. \n","“Am I a dog,” he said to David, “that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. \n","“Come here,” he called to David, “and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!” \n   \n","But David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. \n","This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand. This day I will strike you down, cut off your head, and give the carcasses of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the creatures of the earth. Then the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. \n","And all those assembled here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD’s, and He will give all of you into our hands.” \n   \n","As the Philistine started forward to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. \n","Then David reached into his bag, took out a stone, and slung it, striking the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. \n   \n","Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him. \n","David ran and stood over him. He grabbed the Philistine’s sword and pulled it from its sheath and killed him; and he cut off his head with the sword. \n  When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. \n","Then the men of Israel and Judah charged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath  and to the gates of Ekron. And the bodies of the Philistines were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. \n   \n","When the Israelites returned from their pursuit of the Philistines, they plundered their camps. \n","David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put Goliath’s weapons in his own tent. \n   \n","As Saul had watched David going out to confront the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?” \n  “As surely as you live, O king,” Abner replied, “I do not know.” \n   \n","“Find out whose son this young man is!” said the king. \n   \n","So when David returned from killing the Philistine, still holding his head in his hand, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. \n   \n","“Whose son are you, young man?” asked Saul. \n  “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem,” David replied. \n"],["After David had finished speaking with Saul, the souls of Jonathan and David were knit together, and Jonathan loved him as himself. \n","And from that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father’s house. \n   \n","Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. \n","And Jonathan removed the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, his sword, his bow, and his belt. \n   \n","So David marched out and prospered in everything Saul sent him to do, and Saul set him over the men of war. And this was pleasing in the sight of all the people, and of Saul’s officers as well. \n   \n","As the troops were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs, and with tambourines and other instruments. \n","And as the women danced, they sang out: \n  “Saul has slain his thousands, \n and David his tens of thousands.” \n   \n","And Saul was furious and resented this song. “They have ascribed tens of thousands to David,” he said, “but only thousands to me. What more can he have but the kingdom?” \n","And from that day forward Saul kept a jealous eye on David. \n   \n","The next day a spirit of distress  sent from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house while David played the harp as usual. Now Saul was holding a spear, \n","and he hurled it, thinking, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice. \n   \n","So Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had departed from Saul. \n","Therefore Saul sent David away and gave him command of a thousand men. David led the troops out to battle and back, \n","and he continued to prosper in all his ways, because the LORD was with him. \n   \n","When Saul saw that David was very successful, he was afraid of him. \n","But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he was leading them out to battle and back. \n   \n","Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage. Only be valiant for me and fight the LORD’s battles.” But Saul was thinking, “I need not raise my hand against him; let the hand of the Philistines be against him.” \n   \n","And David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my family or my father’s clan in Israel, that I should become the son-in-law of the king?” \n","So when it was time  to give Saul’s daughter Merab to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah. \n   \n","Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David, and when this was reported to Saul, it pleased him. \n","“I will give her to David,” Saul thought, “so that she may be a snare to him, and the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “For a second time now you can be my son-in-law.” \n   \n","Then Saul ordered his servants, “Speak to David privately and tell him, ‘Behold, the king is pleased with you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become his son-in-law.’” \n   \n","But when Saul’s servants relayed these words to David, he replied, “Does it seem trivial in your sight to be the son-in-law of the king? I am a poor man and lightly esteemed.” \n   \n","And the servants told Saul what David had said. \n   \n","Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king desires no other dowry but a hundred Philistine foreskins as revenge on his enemies.’” But Saul intended to cause David’s death at the hands of the Philistines. \n   \n","When the servants reported these terms to David, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the wedding day arrived, \n","David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented them as payment in full to become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave his daughter Michal to David in marriage. \n   \n","When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David, \n","he grew even more afraid of David. So from then on Saul was David’s enemy. \n   \n","Every time the Philistine commanders came out for battle, David was more successful than all of Saul’s officers, so that his name was highly esteemed. \n"],["Then Saul ordered his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David. \n  But Jonathan delighted greatly in David, \n","so he warned David, saying, “My father Saul intends to kill you. Be on your guard in the morning; find a secret place and hide there. \n","I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, so I can ask about you. And if I find out anything, I will tell you.” \n   \n","Then Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul and said to him, “The king should not sin against his servant David; he has not sinned against you. In fact, his actions have been highly beneficial to you. \n","He took his life in his hands when he struck down the Philistine, and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced, so why would you sin against innocent blood by killing David for no reason?” \n   \n","Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan and swore an oath: “As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be put to death.” \n   \n","So Jonathan summoned David and told him all these things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul to serve him as he had before. \n   \n","When war broke out again, David went out and fought the Philistines and struck them with such a mighty blow that they fled before him. \n   \n","But as Saul was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, a spirit of distress  from the LORD came upon him. While David was playing the harp, \n","Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear. But the spear struck the wall and David eluded him, ran away, and escaped that night. \n   \n","Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him and kill him in the morning. But David’s wife Michal warned him, “If you do not run for your life tonight, tomorrow you will be dead!” \n","So Michal lowered David from the window, and he ran away and escaped. \n   \n","Then Michal took a household idol  and laid it in the bed, placed some goat hair on its head, and covered it with a garment. \n","When Saul sent the messengers to seize David, Michal said, “He is ill.” \n   \n","But Saul sent the messengers back to see David and told them, “Bring him up to me in his bed so I can kill him.” \n","And when the messengers entered, there was the idol in the bed with the quilt of goats’ hair on its head. \n   \n","And Saul said to Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this? You sent my enemy away and he has escaped!” \n  Michal replied, “He said to me, ‘Help me get away, or I will kill you!’” \n   \n","So David ran away and escaped. And he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there. \n   \n","When Saul was told that David was at Naioth in Ramah, \n","he sent messengers to capture him. But when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel leading them, the Spirit of God came upon them, and Saul’s messengers also began to prophesy. \n   \n","When this was reported to Saul, he sent more messengers, but they began to prophesy as well. \n  So Saul tried again and sent messengers a third time, and even they began to prophesy. \n   \n","Finally, Saul himself left for Ramah and came to the large cistern at Secu, where he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” \n  “At Naioth in Ramah,” he was told. \n   \n","So Saul went to Naioth in Ramah. But the Spirit of God came upon even Saul, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah. \n","Then Saul stripped off his robes and also prophesied before Samuel. And he collapsed and lay naked all that day and night. That is why it is said, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” \n"],["Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my iniquity? How have I sinned against your father, that he wants to take my life?” \n   \n","“Far from it!” Jonathan replied. “You will not die. Indeed, my father does nothing, great or small, without telling me. So why would he hide this matter from me? This cannot be true!” \n   \n","But David again vowed, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said, ‘Jonathan must not know of this, or he will be grieved.’ As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, there is but a step between me and death.” \n   \n","Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you desire, I will do for you.” \n   \n","So David told him, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon, and I am supposed to dine with the king. Instead, let me go and hide in the field until the third evening from now. \n","If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David urgently requested my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because there is an annual sacrifice for his whole clan.’ \n","If he says, ‘Good,’ then your servant is safe, but if he is enraged, you will know he has evil intentions. \n","Therefore deal faithfully with your servant, for you have brought me into a covenant with you before the LORD. If there is iniquity in me, then kill me yourself; why should you bring me to your father?” \n   \n","“Never!” Jonathan replied. “If I ever found out that my father had evil intentions against you, would I not tell you?” \n   \n","Then David asked Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?” \n   \n","“Come,” he replied, “let us go out to the field.” \n  So the two of them went out into the field, \n","and Jonathan said, “By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will sound out my father by this time tomorrow or the next day. If he is favorable toward you, will I not send for you and tell you? \n","But if my father intends to bring evil on you, then may the LORD punish me, and ever so severely, if I do not tell you and send you on your way in safety. May the LORD be with you, just as He has been with my father. \n","And as long as I live, treat me with the LORD’s loving devotion, that I may not die, \n","and do not ever cut off your loving devotion from my household—not even when the LORD cuts off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.” \n   \n","So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the LORD hold David’s enemies accountable.” \n","And Jonathan had David reaffirm his vow out of love for him, for Jonathan loved David as he loved himself. \n   \n","Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon, and you will be missed if your seat is empty. \n","When you have stayed three days, hurry down to the place you hid on the day this trouble began, and remain beside the stone Ezel. \n","I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as if I were aiming at a target. \n","Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows!’ Now, if I expressly say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them,’ then come, because as surely as the LORD lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger. \n","But if I say to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, for the LORD has sent you away. \n","And as for the matter you and I have discussed, the LORD is a witness between you and me forever.” \n   \n","So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon had come, the king sat down to eat. \n","He sat in his usual place by the wall, opposite Jonathan and beside Abner, but David’s place was empty. \n","Saul said nothing that day because he thought, “Something has happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.” \n   \n","But on the day after the New Moon, the second day, David’s place was still empty, and Saul asked his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal either yesterday or today?” \n   \n","Jonathan answered, “David urgently requested my permission to go to Bethlehem, \n","saying, ‘Please let me go, because our clan is holding a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has told me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go and see my brothers.’ That is why he did not come to the king’s table.” \n   \n","Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the disgrace of the mother who bore you? \n","For as long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingship shall be established. Now send for him and bring him to me, for he must surely die!” \n   \n","“Why must he be put to death?” Jonathan replied. “What has he done?” \n   \n","Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan to kill him; so Jonathan knew that his father was determined to kill David. \n","Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger and did not eat any food that second day of the month, for he was grieved by his father’s shameful treatment of David. \n   \n","In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the appointment with David, and a small boy was with him. \n","He said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” And as the boy ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him. \n   \n","When the boy reached the place where Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called to him, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” \n","Then Jonathan cried out, “Hurry! Make haste! Do not delay!” So the boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master. \n   \n","But the boy did not know anything; only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement. \n","Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the boy and said, “Go, take it back to the city.” \n   \n","When the young man had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone, fell facedown, and bowed three times. Then he and Jonathan kissed each other and wept together—though David wept more. \n   \n","And Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for the two of us have sworn in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘May the LORD be a witness between you and me, and between your descendants and mine forever.’” Then David got up and departed, and Jonathan went back into the city. \n"],["Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And when Ahimelech met David, he trembled and asked him, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?” \n   \n","“The king has given me a mission,” David replied. “He told me no one is to know about the mission or charge. And I have directed my young men to meet me at a certain place. \n","Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.” \n   \n","“There is no common bread on hand,” the priest replied, “but there is some consecrated bread—provided that the young men have kept themselves from women.” \n   \n","David answered, “Women have indeed been kept from us, as is usual when I set out. And the equipment of the young men is holy, as it is even on common missions, and all the more at this time.” \n   \n","So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there but the Bread of the Presence, which had been removed from before the LORD and replaced with hot bread on the day it was taken away. \n   \n","Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the LORD. And his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief shepherd for Saul. \n   \n","Then David asked Ahimelech, “Is there not a spear or sword on hand here? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business was urgent.” \n   \n","The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want, you may take it. For there is no other but this one.” \n  And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.” \n   \n","That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. \n","But the servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David, the king of the land? Did they not sing about him in their dances, saying: \n  ‘Saul has slain his thousands, \n and David his tens of thousands’?” \n   \n","Now David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath. \n","So he changed his behavior before them and feigned madness in their hands; he scratched on the doors of the gate and let his saliva run down his beard. \n   \n","Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you can see that the man is insane! Why have you brought him to me? \n","Am I in need of madmen, that you have brought this man to rave in my presence? Must this man come into my house?” \n"],["So David left Gath and took refuge in the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and the rest of his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there. \n","And all who were distressed or indebted or discontented rallied around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him. \n   \n","From there David went to Mizpeh of Moab, where he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother stay  with you until I learn what God will do for me.” \n","So he left them in the care of the king of Moab, and they stayed with him the whole time David was in the stronghold. \n   \n","Then the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Depart and go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth. \n   \n","Soon Saul learned that David and his men had been discovered. At that time Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with his spear in hand and all his servants standing around him. \n   \n","Then Saul said to his servants, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Is the son of Jesse giving all of you fields and vineyards and making you commanders of thousands or hundreds? \n","Is that why all of you have conspired against me? Not one of you told me that my own son had made a covenant with the son of Jesse. Not one of you has shown concern for me or revealed to me that my son has stirred up my own servant to lie in wait against me, as is the case today.” \n   \n","But Doeg the Edomite, who had stationed himself with Saul’s servants, answered: “I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob. \n","Ahimelech inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions. He also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.” \n   \n","Then the king sent messengers to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and his father’s whole family, who were priests at Nob. And all of them came to the king. \n","“Listen now, son of Ahitub,” said Saul. \n  “Here I am, my lord,” he replied. \n   \n","And Saul asked him, “Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me? You gave him bread and a sword and inquired of God for him so that he could rise up against me to lie in wait, as he is doing today.” \n   \n","Ahimelech answered the king, “Who among all your servants is as faithful as David, the king’s son-in-law, the captain of your bodyguard who is honored in your house? \n","Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Far be it from me! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of my father’s household, for your servant knew nothing of this whole affair—not in part or in whole.” \n   \n","But the king replied, “You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house!” \n   \n","Then the king ordered the guards at his side, “Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because they too sided with David. For they knew he was fleeing, but they did not tell me.” \n  But the king’s servants would not lift a hand to strike the priests of the LORD. \n   \n","So the king ordered Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests!” \n  And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests himself. On that day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. \n","He also put to the sword Nob, the city of the priests, with its men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep. \n   \n","But one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped. His name was Abiathar, and he fled to David. \n","And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD. \n   \n","Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew that Doeg the Edomite was there that day, and that he was sure to tell Saul. I myself am responsible for the lives of everyone in your father’s house. \n","Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks your life is seeking mine as well. You will be safe with me.” \n"],["Now it was reported to David, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and looting the threshing floors.” \n   \n","So David inquired of the LORD, “Should I go and attack these Philistines?” \n  And the LORD said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.” \n   \n","But David’s men said to him, “Look, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?” \n   \n","Once again, David inquired of the LORD, and the LORD answered him: “Go at once to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.” \n   \n","Then David and his men went to Keilah, fought against the Philistines, and carried off their livestock, striking them with a mighty blow. So David saved the people of Keilah. \n   \n","(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the ephod with him when he fled to David at Keilah.) \n   \n","When Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, he said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he has trapped himself by entering a town with gates and bars.” \n   \n","Then Saul summoned all his troops to go to war at Keilah and besiege David and his men. \n   \n","When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.” \n   \n","And David said, “O LORD, God of Israel, Your servant has heard that Saul intends to come to Keilah and destroy the city on my account. \n","Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O LORD, God of Israel, please tell Your servant.” \n  “He will,” said the LORD. \n   \n","So David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” \n  “They will,” said the LORD. \n   \n","Then David and his men, about six hundred strong, set out and departed from Keilah, moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he declined to go forth. \n   \n","And David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God would not deliver David into his hand. \n   \n","While David was in Horesh in the Wilderness of Ziph, he saw that Saul had come out to take his life. \n","And Saul’s son Jonathan came to David in Horesh and strengthened his hand in God, \n","saying, “Do not be afraid, for my father Saul will never lay a hand on you. And you will be king over Israel, and I will be your second-in-command. Even my father Saul knows this is true.” \n   \n","So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. And David remained in Horesh, while Jonathan went home. \n   \n","Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon? \n","Now, O king, come down whenever your soul desires, and we will be responsible for delivering him into your hand.” \n   \n","“May you be blessed by the LORD,” replied Saul, “for you have had compassion on me. \n","Please go and prepare further. Investigate and watch carefully where he goes and who has seen him there, for I am told that he is extremely cunning. \n","Observe and find out all the places where he hides. Then come back to me with certainty, and I will go with you. If he is in the land, I will search him out among all the clans of Judah.” \n   \n","So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon, \n","and Saul and his men went to seek him.

Even though David was hurrying to get away, Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them. \n   \n","Then a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly, for the Philistines have raided the land!” \n","So Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why that place is called Sela-hammahlekoth. \n","And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En-gedi. \n"],["After Saul had returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.” \n","So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to look for David and his men in the region of the Rocks of the Wild Goats. \n   \n","Soon Saul came to the sheepfolds along the road, where there was a cave, and he went in to relieve himself. And David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave. \n","So David’s men said to him, “This is the day about which the LORD said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do with him as you wish.’” \n  Then David crept up secretly and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe. \n   \n","Afterward, David’s conscience was stricken because he had cut off the corner of Saul’s robe. \n","So he said to his men, “The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD’s anointed. May I never lift my hand against him, since he is the LORD’s anointed.” \n   \n","With these words David restrained his men, and he did not let them rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went on his way. \n   \n","After that, David got up, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” \n  When Saul looked behind him, David bowed facedown in reverence \n","and said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Look, David intends to harm you’? \n","Behold, this day you have seen with your own eyes that the LORD delivered you into my hand in the cave. I was told to kill you, but I spared you and said, ‘I will not lift my hand against my lord, since he is the LORD’s anointed.’ \n   \n","See, my father, look at the corner of your robe in my hand. For I cut it off, but I did not kill you. See and know that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands. I have not sinned against you, even though you are hunting me down to take my life. \n   \n","May the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD take vengeance on you, but my hand will never be against you. \n","As the old proverb says, ‘Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.’ But my hand will never be against you. \n   \n","Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? \n","May the LORD be our judge and decide between you and me. May He take notice and plead my case and deliver me from your hand.” \n   \n","When David had finished saying these things, Saul called back, “Is that your voice, David my son?” \n  Then Saul wept aloud \n","and said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have rewarded me with good, though I have rewarded you with evil. \n","And you have shown this day how well you have dealt with me; for when the LORD delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me. \n","When a man finds his enemy, does he let him go away unharmed? May the LORD reward you with good for what you have done for me this day. \n   \n","Now I know for sure that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. \n","So now, swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s house.” \n   \n","So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. \n"],["When Samuel died, all Israel gathered to mourn for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. \n  Then David set out and went down to the Wilderness of Paran. \n   \n","Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. He was a very wealthy man with a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. \n","His name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was harsh and evil in his dealings. \n   \n","While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep. \n","So David sent ten young men and instructed them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel. Greet him in my name \n","and say to him, ‘Long life to you, and peace to you and your house and to all that belongs to you. \n","Now I hear that it is time for shearing. When your shepherds were with us, we did not harass them, and nothing of theirs was missing the whole time they were in Carmel. \n","Ask your young men, and they will tell you. So let my young men find favor with you, for we have come on the day of a feast. Please give whatever you can afford to your servants and to your son David.’” \n   \n","When David’s young men arrived, they relayed all these words to Nabal on behalf of David. Then they waited. \n   \n","But Nabal asked them, “Who is David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants these days are breaking away from their masters. \n","Why should I take my bread and water and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give them to these men whose origin I do not know?” \n   \n","So David’s men turned around and went back, and they relayed to him all these words. \n   \n","And David said to his men, “Strap on your swords!” So David and all his men put on their swords, and about four hundred men followed David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies. \n   \n","Meanwhile, one of Nabal’s young men informed Nabal’s wife Abigail, “Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he scolded them. \n","Yet these men were very good to us. When we were in the field, we were not harassed, and nothing of ours went missing the whole time we lived among them. \n","They were a wall around us, both day and night, the whole time we were herding our sheep near them. \n","Now consider carefully what you must do, because disaster looms over our master and all his household. For he is such a scoundrel that nobody can speak to him!” \n   \n","Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five butchered sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs. She loaded them on donkeys \n","and said to her young men, “Go ahead of me. I will be right behind you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal. \n   \n","As Abigail came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, she saw David and his men coming down toward her, and she met them. \n   \n","Now David had just finished saying, “In vain I have protected all that belonged to this man in the wilderness. Nothing that belongs to him has gone missing, yet he has paid me back evil for good. \n","May God punish David, and ever so severely, if I let one of Nabal’s men survive until morning.” \n   \n","When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off the donkey, fell facedown, and bowed before him. \n","She fell at his feet and said, “My lord, may the blame be on me alone, but please let your servant speak to you; hear the words of your servant. \n","My lord should pay no attention to this scoundrel Nabal, for he lives up to his name: His name means Fool, and folly accompanies him. I, your servant, did not see my lord’s young men whom you sent. \n   \n","Now, my lord, as surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, the LORD has held you back from coming to bloodshed and avenging yourself with your own hand. May your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be like Nabal. \n   \n","Now let this gift your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow you. \n","Please forgive your servant’s offense, for the LORD will surely make a lasting dynasty for my lord, because he fights the LORD’s battles. May no evil be found in you as long as you live. \n   \n","And should someone pursue you and seek your life, then the life of my lord will be bound securely by the LORD your God in the bundle of the living. But He shall fling away the lives of your enemies like stones from a sling. \n   \n","When the LORD has done for my lord all the good He promised, and when He has appointed you ruler over Israel, \n","then my lord will have no remorse or guilt of conscience over needless bloodshed and revenge. And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, may you remember your maidservant.” \n   \n","Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you to meet me this day! \n","Blessed is your discernment, and blessed are you, because today you kept me from bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand. \n","Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has restrained me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, then surely no male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by morning light.” \n   \n","Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him, and he said to her, “Go home in peace. See, I have heeded your voice and granted your request.” \n   \n","When Abigail returned to Nabal, there he was in the house, holding a feast fit for a king, in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until morning light. \n   \n","In the morning when Nabal was sober, his wife told him about these events, and his heart failed within him and he became like a stone. \n","About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal dead. \n   \n","On hearing that Nabal was dead, David said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has upheld my cause against the reproach of Nabal and has restrained His servant from evil. For the LORD has brought the wickedness of Nabal down upon his own head.” \n  Then David sent word to Abigail, asking for her in marriage. \n","When his servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said, “David has sent us to take you as his wife.” \n   \n","She arose, then bowed facedown and said, “Here is your maidservant, ready to serve and to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.” \n   \n","So Abigail hurried and got on a donkey, and attended by five of her maidens, she followed David’s messengers and became his wife. \n   \n","David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel. So she and Abigail were both his wives. \n","But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti  son of Laish, who was from Gallim. \n"],["Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hachilah, opposite Jeshimon?” \n","So Saul, accompanied by three thousand chosen men of Israel, went down to the Wilderness of Ziph to search for David there. \n   \n","Saul camped beside the road at the hill of Hachilah opposite Jeshimon, but David was living in the wilderness. When he realized that Saul had followed him there, \n","David sent out spies to verify that Saul had arrived. \n   \n","Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general of his army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the inner circle of the camp, with the troops camped around him. \n","And David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” \n  “I will go with you,” answered Abishai. \n   \n","That night David and Abishai came to the troops, and Saul was lying there asleep in the inner circle of the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the troops were lying around him. \n   \n","Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand. Now, therefore, please let me thrust the spear through him into the ground with one stroke. I will not need to strike him twice!” \n   \n","But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him, for who can lift a hand against the LORD’s anointed and be guiltless?” \n","David added, “As surely as the LORD lives, the LORD Himself will strike him down; either his day will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish. \n","But the LORD forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed. Instead, take the spear and water jug by his head, and let us go.” \n   \n","So David took the spear and water jug by Saul’s head, and they departed. No one saw them or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up; they all remained asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them. \n   \n","Then David crossed to the other side and stood atop the mountain at a distance; there was a wide gulf between them. \n","And David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner, “Will you not answer me, Abner?” \n  “Who calls to the king?” Abner replied. \n   \n","So David said to Abner, “You are a man, aren’t you? And who in Israel is your equal? Why then did you not protect your lord the king when one of the people came to destroy him? \n","This thing you have done is not good. As surely as the LORD lives, all of you deserve to die, since you did not protect your lord, the LORD’s anointed. Now look around. Where are the king’s spear and water jug that were by his head?” \n   \n","Then Saul recognized David’s voice and asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” \n  “It is my voice, my lord and king,” David said. \n   \n","And he continued, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done? What evil is in my hand? \n","Now please, may my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If the LORD has stirred you up against me, then may He accept an offering.

For the king of Israel has come out to look for a flea, like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.” \n   \n","Then Saul replied, “I have sinned. Come back, David my son. I will never harm you again, because today you considered my life precious. I have played the fool and have committed a grave error!” \n   \n","“Here is the king’s spear,” David answered. “Let one of the young men come over and get it. \n","May the LORD repay every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. For the LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed. \n","As surely as I valued your life today, so may the LORD value my life and rescue me from all trouble.” \n   \n","Saul said to him, “May you be blessed, David my son.

Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal. \n","And when Saul learned that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him. \n   \n","Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let me be assigned a place in one of the outlying towns, so I can live there. For why should your servant live in the royal city with you?” \n   \n","That day Achish gave him Ziklag, and to this day it still belongs to the kings of Judah. \n","And the time that David lived in Philistine territory amounted to a year and four months. \n   \n","Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these people had inhabited the land extending to Shur and Egypt.) \n","Whenever David attacked a territory, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but he took the flocks and herds, the donkeys, camels, and clothing. \n  Then he would return to Achish, \n","who would ask him, “What have you raided today?” \n  And David would reply, “The Negev of Judah,” or “The Negev of Jerahmeel,” or “The Negev of the Kenites.” \n   \n","David did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he said, “Otherwise they will report us, saying, ‘This is what David did.’” And this was David’s custom the whole time he lived in Philistine territory. \n   \n","So Achish trusted David, thinking, “Since he has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel, he will be my servant forever.” \n"],["Now in those days the Philistines gathered their forces for warfare against Israel. So Achish said to David, “You must understand that you and your men are to go out to battle with me.” \n   \n","David replied, “Then you will come to know what your servant can do.” \n  “Very well,” said Achish. “I will make you my bodyguard for life.” \n   \n","Now by this time Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city.

They came to the woman at night, and Saul said, “Consult a spirit for me.

You are Saul!” \n   \n","“Do not be afraid,” the king replied. “What do you see?” \n  “I see a god  coming up out of the earth,” the woman answered. \n   \n","“What does he look like?” asked Saul. \n  “An old man is coming up,” she replied. “And he is wearing a robe.” \n  So Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed facedown in reverence. \n   \n","Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” \n  “I am deeply distressed,” replied Saul. “The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams.

They had not killed anyone, but had carried them off as they went on their way. \n   \n","When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned down and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive. \n","So David and the troops with him lifted up their voices and wept until they had no strength left to weep. \n   \n","David’s two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel, had been taken captive. \n","And David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of every man grieved for his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God. \n   \n","Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod.” \n  So Abiathar brought it to him, \n","and David inquired of the LORD: “Should I pursue these raiders? Will I overtake them?” \n  “Pursue them,” the LORD replied, “for you will surely overtake them and rescue the captives.” \n   \n","So David and his six hundred men went to the Brook of Besor, where some stayed behind \n","because two hundred men were too exhausted to cross the brook. But David and four hundred men continued in pursuit. \n   \n","Now his men found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David. They gave the man water to drink and food to eat—\n","a piece of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins. So he ate and was revived, for he had not had any food or water for three days and three nights. \n   \n","Then David asked him, “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?” \n  “I am an Egyptian,” he replied, “the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me three days ago when I fell ill. \n","We raided the Negev of the Cherethites, the territory of Judah, and the Negev of Caleb, and we burned down Ziklag.” \n   \n","“Will you lead me to these raiders?” David asked. \n  And the man replied, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hand of my master, and I will lead you to them.” \n   \n","So he led David down, and there were the Amalekites spread out over all the land, eating, drinking, and celebrating the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and the land of Judah. \n","And David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man escaped, except four hundred young men who fled, riding off on camels. \n   \n","So David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives. \n","Nothing was missing, young or old, son or daughter, or any of the plunder the Amalekites had taken. David brought everything back. \n","And he recovered all the flocks and herds, which his men drove ahead of the other livestock, calling out, “This is David’s plunder!” \n   \n","When David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him from the Brook of Besor, they came out to meet him and the troops with him. As David approached the men, he greeted them, \n","but all the wicked and worthless men among those who had gone with David said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered, except for each man’s wife and children. They may take them and go.” \n   \n","But David said, “My brothers, you must not do this with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and delivered into our hands the raiders who came against us. \n","Who will listen to your proposal? The share of the one who went to battle will match the share of the one who stayed with the supplies. They will share alike.” \n   \n","And so it has been from that day forward. David established this statute as an ordinance for Israel to this very day. \n   \n","When David arrived in Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, “Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the LORD’s enemies.” \n","He sent gifts to those in Bethel, Ramoth Negev, and Jattir; \n","to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, and Eshtemoa; \n","to those in Racal and in the cities of the Jerahmeelites and Kenites; \n","to those in Hormah, Bor-ashan, and Athach; \n","and to those in Hebron and in all the places where David and his men had roamed. \n"],["Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa. \n   \n","The Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua. \n","When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers overtook him and wounded him critically. \n   \n","Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run it through me, or these uncircumcised men will come and run me through and torture me!” \n  But his armor-bearer was terrified and refused to do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it. \n   \n","When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his own sword and died with him. \n   \n","So Saul, his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together that same day. \n   \n","When the Israelites along the valley and those on the other side of the Jordan saw that the army of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their cities and ran away. So the Philistines came and occupied their cities. \n   \n","The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. \n","They cut off Saul’s head, stripped off his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temples of their idols and among their people. \n","They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and hung his body on the wall of Beth-shan. \n   \n","When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, \n","all their men of valor set out, journeyed all night, and retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shan. \n  When they arrived at Jabesh, they burned the bodies there. \n","Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days. "]],"II Samuel":[["After the death of Saul, David returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days. \n","On the third day a man with torn clothes and dust on his head arrived from Saul’s camp. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him homage. \n   \n","“Where have you come from?” David asked. \n  “I have escaped from the Israelite camp,” he replied. \n   \n","“What was the outcome?” David asked. “Please tell me.” \n  “The troops fled from the battle,” he replied. “Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.” \n   \n","Then David asked the young man who had brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” \n   \n","“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” he replied, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and the cavalry closing in on him. \n","When he turned around and saw me, he called out and I answered, ‘Here I am!’ \n   \n","‘Who are you?’ he asked. \n  So I told him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ \n   \n","Then he begged me, ‘Stand over me and kill me, for agony has seized me, but my life still lingers.’ \n   \n","So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.” \n   \n","Then David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and all the men who were with him did the same. \n","They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the people of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. \n   \n","And David inquired of the young man who had brought him the report, “Where are you from?” \n  “I am the son of a foreigner,” he answered. “I am an Amalekite.” \n   \n","So David asked him, “Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?” \n","Then David summoned one of the young men and said, “Go, execute him!” So the young man struck him down, and he died. \n","For David had said to the Amalekite, “Your blood be on your own head because your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I killed the LORD’s anointed.’” \n   \n","Then David took up this lament for Saul and his son Jonathan, \n","and he ordered that the sons of Judah be taught the Song of the Bow.  It is written in the Book of Jashar: \n   \n","“Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. \n How the mighty have fallen! \n   \n","Tell it not in Gath; \n proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, \n lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, \n and the daughters of the uncircumcised exult. \n  \n","O mountains of Gilboa, \n may you have no dew or rain, \n no fields yielding offerings of grain. \n For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, \n the shield of Saul, no longer anointed with oil. \n   \n","From the blood of the slain, \n from the fat of the mighty, \n the bow of Jonathan did not retreat, \n and the sword of Saul did not return empty. \n  \n","Saul and Jonathan, beloved and delightful in life, \n were not divided in death. \n They were swifter than eagles, \n they were stronger than lions. \n   \n","O daughters of Israel, \n weep for Saul, \n who clothed you in scarlet and luxury, \n who decked your garments with ornaments of gold. \n  \n","How the mighty have fallen in the thick of battle! \n Jonathan lies slain on your heights. \n   \n","I grieve for you, Jonathan, my brother. \n You were delightful to me; \n your love to me was extraordinary, \n surpassing the love of women. \n  \n","How the mighty have fallen \n and the weapons of war have perished!” \n"],["Some time later, David inquired of the LORD, “Should I go up to one of the towns of Judah?” \n  “Go up,” the LORD answered. \n  Then David asked, “Where should I go?” \n  “To Hebron,” replied the LORD. \n   \n","So David went there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel. \n","David also took the men who were with him, each with his household, and they settled in the towns near Hebron. \n   \n","Then the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, “It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul.” \n   \n","So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead to tell them, “The LORD bless you, because you showed this kindness to Saul your lord when you buried him. \n","Now may the LORD show you loving devotion  and faithfulness, and I will also show you the same favor because you have done this. \n","Now then, be strong and courageous, for though Saul your lord is dead, the house of Judah has anointed me as their king.” \n   \n","Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, took Saul’s son Ish-bosheth, moved him to Mahanaim, \n","and made him king over Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin—over all Israel. \n   \n","Saul’s son Ish-bosheth was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for two years. \n  The house of Judah, however, followed David. \n","And the length of time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. \n   \n","One day Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth son of Saul marched out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. \n","So Joab son of Zeruiah, along with the servants of David, marched out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. And the two camps took up positions on opposite sides of the pool. \n   \n","Then Abner said to Joab, “Let us have the young men get up and compete before us.” \n  “Let them get up,” Joab replied. \n   \n","So they got up and were counted off—twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David. \n","Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into his opponent’s side, and they all fell together. So this place, which is in Gibeon, is called Helkath-hazzurim. \n   \n","The battle that day was intense, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by the servants of David. \n   \n","The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was fleet of foot like a wild gazelle, \n","and he chased Abner, not turning to the right or to the left in his pursuit. \n","And Abner glanced back and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” \n  “It is,” Asahel replied. \n   \n","So Abner told him, “Turn to your right or to your left, seize one of the young men, and take his equipment for yourself.” \n  But Asahel would not stop chasing him. \n   \n","Once again, Abner warned Asahel, “Stop chasing me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I show my face to your brother Joab?” \n   \n","But Asahel refused to turn away; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into his stomach, and it came out his back, and he fell dead on the spot. And every man paused when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died. \n","But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. By sunset, they had gone as far as the hill of Ammah opposite Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. \n   \n","The Benjamites rallied to Abner, formed a single unit, and took their stand atop a hill. \n","Then Abner called out to Joab: “Must the sword devour forever? Do you not realize that this will only end in bitterness? How long before you tell the troops to stop pursuing their brothers?” \n   \n","“As surely as God lives,” Joab replied, “if you had not spoken up, the troops would have continued pursuing their brothers until morning.” \n   \n","So Joab blew the ram’s horn, and all the troops stopped; they no longer pursued Israel or continued to fight. \n","And all that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, marched all morning, and arrived at Mahanaim. \n   \n","When Joab returned from pursuing Abner, he gathered all the troops. \n  In addition to Asahel, nineteen of David’s servants were missing, \n","but they had struck down 360 Benjamites who were with Abner. \n","Later, they took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and reached Hebron at daybreak. \n"],["Now the war between the house of Saul and the house of David was protracted. And David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker. \n   \n","And sons were born to David in Hebron: \n  His firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam of Jezreel; \n   \n","his second was Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; \n  his third was Absalom, the son of Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur; \n   \n","his fourth was Adonijah, the son of Haggith; \n  his fifth was Shephatiah, the son of Abital; \n   \n","and his sixth was Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. \n  These sons were born to David in Hebron. \n   \n","During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had continued to strengthen his position in the house of Saul. \n","Meanwhile, Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. So Ish-bosheth questioned Abner, “Why did you sleep with my father’s concubine?” \n   \n","Abner was furious over Ish-bosheth’s accusation. “Am I the head of a dog that belongs to Judah?” he asked. “All this time I have been loyal to the house of your father Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends. I have not delivered you into the hand of David, but now you accuse me of wrongdoing with this woman! \n","May God punish Abner, and ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the LORD has sworn to him: \n","to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.” \n   \n","And for fear of Abner, Ish-bosheth did not dare to say another word to him. \n   \n","Then Abner sent messengers in his place to say to David, “To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and surely my hand will be with you to bring all Israel over to you.” \n   \n","“Good,” replied David, “I will make a covenant with you. But there is one thing I require of you: Do not appear before me unless you bring Saul’s daughter Michal when you come to see me.” \n   \n","Then David sent messengers to say to Ish-bosheth son of Saul, “Give me back my wife, Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred Philistine foreskins.” \n   \n","So Ish-bosheth sent and took Michal from her husband Paltiel  son of Laish. \n","Her husband followed her, weeping all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go back.” So he returned home. \n   \n","Now Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, “In the past you sought David as your king. \n","Now take action, because the LORD has said to David, ‘Through My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hands of the Philistines and of all their enemies.’” \n   \n","Abner also spoke to the Benjamites and went to Hebron to tell David all that seemed good to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin. \n","When Abner and twenty of his men came to David at Hebron, David held a feast for them. \n   \n","Then Abner said to David, “Let me go at once, and I will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires.” \n  So David dismissed Abner, and he went in peace. \n   \n","Just then David’s soldiers and Joab returned from a raid, bringing with them a great plunder. But Abner was not with David in Hebron because David had sent him on his way in peace. \n","When Joab and all his troops arrived, he was informed, “Abner son of Ner came to see the king, who sent him on his way in peace.” \n   \n","So Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you dismiss him? Now he is getting away! \n","Surely you realize that Abner son of Ner came to deceive you and to track your movements and all that you are doing.” \n   \n","As soon as Joab had left David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David was unaware of it. \n   \n","When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab pulled him aside into the gateway, as if to speak to him privately, and there Joab stabbed him in the stomach. So Abner died on account of the blood of Joab’s brother Asahel. \n   \n","Afterward, David heard about this and said, “I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner. \n","May it whirl over the heads of Joab and the entire house of his father, and may the house of Joab never be without one having a discharge or skin disease, or one who leans on a staff or falls by the sword or lacks food.” \n   \n","(Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.) \n   \n","Then David ordered Joab and all the people with him, “Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David himself walked behind the funeral bier. \n   \n","When they buried Abner in Hebron, the king wept aloud at Abner’s tomb, and all the people wept. \n","And the king sang this lament for Abner: \n  “Should Abner die \n the death of a fool? \n  \n","Your hands were not bound, \n your feet were not fettered. \n As a man falls before the wicked, \n so also you fell.” \n  And all the people wept over him even more. \n   \n","Then all the people came and urged David to eat something while it was still day, but David took an oath, saying, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!” \n   \n","All the people took note and were pleased. In fact, everything the king did pleased them. \n","So on that day all the troops and all Israel were convinced that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner. \n   \n","Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not realize that a great prince has fallen today in Israel? \n","And I am weak this day, though anointed as king, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too fierce for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil!” \n"],["Now when Ish-bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel was dismayed. \n","Saul’s son had two men who were leaders of raiding parties. One was named Baanah and the other Rechab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the tribe of Benjamin—Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin, \n","because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have lived there as foreigners to this day. \n   \n","And Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the report about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she was hurrying to escape, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth. \n   \n","Now Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out and arrived at the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day, while the king was taking his midday nap. \n","They entered the interior of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah slipped away. \n   \n","They had entered the house while Ish-bosheth was lying on his bed, and having stabbed and killed him, they beheaded him, took his head, and traveled all night by way of the Arabah. \n","They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life. Today the LORD has granted vengeance to my lord the king against Saul and his offspring.” \n   \n","But David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As surely as the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress, \n","when someone told me, ‘Look, Saul is dead,’ and thought he was a bearer of good news, I seized him and put him to death at Ziklag. That was his reward for his news! \n","How much more, when wicked men kill a righteous man in his own house and on his own bed, shall I not now require his blood from your hands and remove you from the earth!” \n   \n","So David commanded his young men, and they killed Rechab and Baanah. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies by the pool in Hebron, but they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron. \n"],["Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Here we are, your own flesh and blood. \n","Even in times past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them back. And to you the LORD said, ‘You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be ruler over them.’” \n   \n","So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, where King David made with them a covenant before the LORD. And they anointed him king over Israel. \n   \n","David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years. \n","In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah. \n   \n","Now the king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites who inhabited the land. The Jebusites said to David: “You will never get in here. Even the blind and lame can repel you.” For they thought, “David cannot get in here.” \n   \n","Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David). \n","On that day he said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites must use the water shaft to reach the lame and blind who are despised by David. ” That is why it is said, “The blind and the lame will never enter the palace.” \n   \n","So David took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built it up all the way around, from the supporting terraces  inward. \n","And David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of Hosts was with him. \n   \n","Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David. \n   \n","And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel. \n   \n","After he had arrived from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him. \n","These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, \n","Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, \n","Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet. \n   \n","When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they all went in search of him; but David learned of this and went down to the stronghold. \n   \n","Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. \n","So David inquired of the LORD, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” \n  “Go,” replied the LORD, “for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hand.” \n   \n","So David went to Baal-perazim, where he defeated the Philistines and said, “Like a bursting flood, the LORD has burst out against my enemies before me.” So he called that place Baal-perazim. \n","There the Philistines abandoned their idols, and David and his men carried them away. \n   \n","Once again the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. \n","So David inquired of the LORD, who answered, “Do not march straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the balsam trees. \n","As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move quickly, because this will mean that the LORD has marched out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.” \n   \n","So David did as the LORD had commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon  to Gezer. \n"],["David again assembled the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand in all. \n","And he and all his troops set out for Baale of Judah   to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name— the name of the LORD of Hosts, who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on it. \n   \n","They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart, \n","bringing with it the ark of God. And Ahio was walking in front of the ark. \n   \n","David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of wood instruments, harps, stringed instruments, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals. \n   \n","When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen had stumbled. \n","And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and God struck him down on the spot for his irreverence, and he died there beside the ark of God. \n   \n","Then David became angry because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah; so he named that place Perez-uzzah, as it is called to this day. \n   \n","That day David feared the LORD and asked, “How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?” \n","So he was unwilling to move the ark of the LORD to the City of David; instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. \n","Thus the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed him and all his household. \n   \n","Now it was reported to King David, “The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.” \n  So David went and had the ark of God brought up from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David with rejoicing. \n","When those carrying the ark of the LORD had advanced six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf. \n   \n","And David, wearing a linen ephod, danced with all his might before the LORD, \n","while he and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and the sounding of the ram’s horn. \n   \n","As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart. \n   \n","So they brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. \n   \n","When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of Hosts. \n","Then he distributed to every man and woman among the multitude of Israel a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake. And all the people departed, each for his own home. \n   \n","As soon as David returned home to bless his own household, Saul’s daughter Michal came out to meet him. “How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today!” she said. “He has uncovered himself today in the sight of the maidservants of his subjects, like a vulgar person would do.” \n   \n","But David said to Michal, “I was dancing before the LORD, who chose me over your father and all his house when He appointed me ruler over the LORD’s people Israel. I will celebrate before the LORD, \n","and I will humiliate and humble myself even more than this. Yet I will be honored by the maidservants of whom you have spoken.” \n   \n","And Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death. \n"],["After the king had settled into his palace and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him, \n","he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent.” \n   \n","And Nathan replied to the king, “Go and do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.” \n   \n","But that night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying, \n","“Go and tell My servant David that this is what the LORD says: Are you the one to build for Me a house to dwell in? \n","For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt until this day, but I have moved about with a tent as My dwelling. \n","In all My journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever asked any of the leaders  I appointed to shepherd My people Israel, ‘Why haven’t you built Me a house of cedar?’ \n   \n","Now then, you are to tell My servant David that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over My people Israel. \n","I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name like the greatest in the land. \n   \n","And I will provide a place for My people Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their own and be disturbed no more.

He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children.

Instead, he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for his guest.” \n   \n","David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan: “As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die! \n","Because he has done this thing and has shown no pity, he must pay for the lamb four times over.” \n   \n","Then Nathan said to David, “You are that man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. \n","I gave your master’s house to you and your master’s wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah, and if that was not enough, I would have given you even more. \n   \n","Why then have you despised the command of the LORD by doing evil in His sight? You put Uriah the Hittite to the sword and took his wife as your own, for you have slain him with the sword of the Ammonites. \n","Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.’ \n   \n","This is what the LORD says: ‘I will raise up adversity against you from your own house. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to another, and he will lie with them in broad daylight. \n","You have acted in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.’” \n   \n","Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” \n  “The LORD has taken away your sin,” Nathan replied. “You will not die. \n","Nevertheless, because by this deed you have shown utter contempt for the word of the LORD, the son born to you will surely die.” \n   \n","After Nathan had gone home, the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife had borne to David, and he became ill. \n","David pleaded with God for the boy. He fasted and went into his house and spent the night lying in sackcloth  on the ground. \n","The elders of his household stood beside him to help him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat anything with them. \n   \n","On the seventh day the child died. But David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Look, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to us. So how can we tell him the child is dead? He may even harm himself.” \n   \n","When David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he perceived that the child was dead. So he asked his servants, “Is the child dead?” \n  “He is dead,” they replied. \n   \n","Then David got up from the ground, washed and anointed himself, changed his clothes, and went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they set food before him, and he ate. \n   \n","“What is this you have done?” his servants asked. “While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but when he died, you got up and ate.” \n   \n","David answered, “While the child was alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, ‘Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let him live.’ \n","But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.” \n   \n","Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay with her. So she gave birth to a son, and they  named him Solomon. \n  Now the LORD loved the child \n","and sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah because the LORD loved him. \n   \n","Meanwhile, Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal fortress. \n","Then Joab sent messengers to David to say, “I have fought against Rabbah and have captured the water supply of the city. \n","Now, therefore, assemble the rest of the troops, lay siege to the city, and capture it. Otherwise I will capture the city, and it will be named after me.” \n   \n","So David assembled all the troops and went to Rabbah; and he fought against it and captured it. \n","Then he took the crown from the head of their king.  It weighed a talent of gold  and was set with precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head. And David took a great amount of plunder from the city. \n   \n","David brought out the people who were there and put them to work with saws,  iron picks, and axes, and he made them work at the brick kilns. He did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem. \n"],["After some time, David’s son Amnon fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of David’s son Absalom. \n","Amnon was sick with frustration over his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed implausible for him to do anything to her. \n   \n","Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very shrewd man, \n","so he asked Amnon, “Why are you, the son of the king, so depressed morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?” \n  Amnon replied, “I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.” \n   \n","Jonadab told him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend you are ill. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare it in my sight so I may watch her and eat it from her hand.’” \n   \n","So Amnon lay down and feigned illness. When the king came to see him, Amnon said, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, so that I may eat from her hand.” \n   \n","Then David sent word to Tamar at the palace: “Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare a meal for him.” \n   \n","So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked them. \n","Then she brought the pan and set it down before him, but he refused to eat. “Send everyone away!” said Amnon. And everyone went out. \n   \n","Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, so that I may eat it from your hand.” \n  Tamar took the cakes she had made and went to her brother Amnon’s bedroom. \n","And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said, “Come lie with me, my sister!” \n   \n","“No, my brother!” she cried. “Do not humiliate me, for such a thing should never be done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing! \n","Where could I ever take my shame? And you would be like one of the fools in Israel! Please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.” \n   \n","But Amnon refused to listen to her, and being stronger, he violated her and lay with her. \n   \n","Then Amnon hated Tamar with such intensity that his hatred was greater than the love he previously had. “Get up!” he said to her. “Be gone!” \n   \n","“No,” she replied, “sending me away is worse than this great wrong you have already done to me!” \n  But he refused to listen to her. \n","Instead, he called to his attendant and said, “Throw this woman out and bolt the door behind her!” \n   \n","So Amnon’s attendant threw her out and bolted the door behind her. Now Tamar was wearing a robe of many colors, because this is what the king’s virgin daughters wore. \n","And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her robe. And putting her hand on her head, she went away crying bitterly. \n   \n","Her brother Absalom said to her, “Has your brother Amnon been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister. He is your brother. Do not take this thing to heart.” \n  So Tamar lived as a desolate woman in the house of her brother Absalom. \n   \n","When King David heard all this, he was furious. \n","And Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad, because he hated Amnon for disgracing his sister Tamar. \n   \n","Two years later, when Absalom’s sheepshearers were at Baal-hazor near Ephraim, he invited all the sons of the king. \n","And he went to the king and said, “Your servant has just hired shearers. Will the king and his servants please come with me?” \n   \n","“No, my son,” the king replied, “we should not all go, or we would be a burden to you.” Although Absalom urged him, he was not willing to go, but gave him his blessing. \n   \n","“If not,” said Absalom, “please let my brother Amnon go with us.” \n  “Why should he go with you?” the king asked. \n   \n","But Absalom urged him, so the king sent Amnon and the rest of his sons. \n   \n","Now Absalom had ordered his young men, “Watch Amnon until his heart is merry with wine, and when I order you to strike Amnon down, you are to kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and valiant!” \n   \n","So Absalom’s young men did to Amnon just as Absalom had ordered. Then all the other sons of the king got up, and each one fled on his mule. \n   \n","While they were on the way, a report reached David: “Absalom has struck down all the sons of the king; not one of them is left!” \n   \n","Then the king stood up, tore his clothes, and lay down on the ground; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn. \n   \n","But Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, spoke up: “My lord must not think they have killed all the sons of the king, for only Amnon is dead. In fact, Absalom has planned this since the day Amnon violated his sister Tamar. \n","So now, my lord the king, do not take to heart the report that all the sons of the king are dead. Only Amnon is dead.” \n   \n","Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. When the young man standing watch looked up, he saw many people coming down the road west of him,  along the side of the hill. And the watchman went and reported to the king, “I see men coming from the direction of Horonaim, along the side of the hill.” \n   \n","So Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the sons of the king have arrived! It is just as your servant said.” \n   \n","And as he finished speaking, the sons of the king came in, wailing loudly. Then the king and all his servants also wept very bitterly. \n   \n","Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But David mourned for his son every day. \n   \n","After Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, he stayed there three years. \n","And King David   longed to go to Absalom, for he had been consoled over Amnon’s death. \n"],["Now Joab son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart longed for Absalom. \n","So Joab sent to Tekoa to bring a wise woman from there. He told her, “Please pretend to be a mourner; put on clothes for mourning and do not anoint yourself with oil. Act like a woman who has mourned for the dead a long time. \n","Then go to the king and speak these words to him.” And Joab put the words in her mouth. \n   \n","When the woman from Tekoa went to the king, she fell facedown in homage and said, “Help me, O king!” \n   \n","“What troubles you?” the king asked her. \n  “Indeed,” she said, “I am a widow, for my husband is dead. \n","And your maidservant had two sons who were fighting in the field with no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him. \n","Now the whole clan has risen up against your maidservant and said, ‘Hand over the one who struck down his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of the brother whom he killed. Then we will cut off the heir as well!’ So they would extinguish my one remaining ember by not preserving my husband’s name or posterity on the earth.” \n   \n","“Go home,” the king said to the woman, “and I will give orders on your behalf.” \n   \n","But the woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord the king, may any blame be on me and on my father’s house, and may the king and his throne be guiltless.” \n   \n","“If anyone speaks to you,” said the king, “bring him to me, and he will not trouble you again!” \n   \n","“Please,” she replied, “may the king invoke the LORD your God to prevent the avenger of blood from increasing the devastation, so that my son may not be destroyed!” \n  “As surely as the LORD lives,” he vowed, “not a hair of your son’s head will fall to the ground.” \n   \n","Then the woman said, “Please, may your servant speak a word to my lord the king?” \n  “Speak,” he replied. \n   \n","The woman asked, “Why have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, since he has not brought back his own banished son? \n","For surely we will die and be like water poured out on the ground, which cannot be recovered. Yet God does not take away a life; but He devises ways that the banished one may not be cast out from Him. \n   \n","Now therefore, I have come to present this matter to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king. Perhaps he will grant the request of his maidservant. \n","For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would cut off both me and my son from God’s inheritance.’ \n   \n","And now your servant says, ‘May the word of my lord the king bring me rest, for my lord the king is able to discern good and evil, just like the angel  of God. May the LORD your God be with you.’” \n   \n","Then the king said to the woman, “I am going to ask you something; do not conceal it from me!” \n  “Let my lord the king speak,” she replied. \n   \n","So the king asked, “Is the hand of Joab behind all this?” \n  The woman answered, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king says. Yes, your servant Joab is the one who gave me orders; he told your maidservant exactly what to say. \n","Joab your servant has done this to bring about this change of affairs, but my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know everything that happens in the land.” \n   \n","Then the king said to Joab, “I hereby grant this request. Go, bring back the young man Absalom.” \n   \n","Joab fell facedown in homage and blessed the king. “Today,” said Joab, “your servant knows that he has found favor with you, my lord the king, because the king has granted his request.” \n   \n","So Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. \n","But the king added, “He may return to his house, but he must not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, but he did not see the king. \n   \n","Now there was not a man in all Israel as handsome and highly praised as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the top of his head, he did not have a single flaw. \n","And when he cut the hair of his head—he shaved it every year because his hair got so heavy—he would weigh it out to be two hundred shekels, according to the royal standard. \n   \n","Three sons were born to Absalom, and a daughter named Tamar, who was a beautiful woman. \n   \n","Now Absalom lived in Jerusalem two years without seeing the face of the king. \n","Then he sent for Joab to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. \n  So Absalom sent a second time, but Joab still would not come. \n   \n","Then Absalom said to his servants, “Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire!” \n  And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire. \n   \n","Then Joab came to Absalom’s house and demanded, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?” \n   \n","“Look,” said Absalom, “I sent for you and said, ‘Come here. I want to send you to the king to ask: Why have I come back from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there.’ So now, let me see the king’s face, and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.” \n   \n","So Joab went and told the king, and David summoned Absalom, who came to him and bowed facedown before him. Then the king kissed Absalom. \n"],["Some time later, Absalom provided for himself a chariot with horses and fifty men to run ahead of him. \n","He would get up early and stand beside the road leading to the city gate. \n  Whenever anyone had a grievance to bring before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out and ask, “What city are you from?” And if he replied, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel,” \n","Absalom would say, “Look, your claims are good and right, but the king has no deputy to hear you.” \n   \n","And he would add, “If only someone would appoint me judge in the land, then everyone with a grievance or dispute could come to me, and I would give him justice.” \n   \n","Also, when anyone approached to bow down to him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him. \n","Absalom did this to all the Israelites who came to the king for justice. In this way he stole the hearts of the men of Israel. \n   \n","After four  years had passed, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go to Hebron to fulfill a vow I have made to the LORD. \n","For your servant made a vow while dwelling in Geshur of Aram, saying: ‘If indeed the LORD brings me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the LORD in Hebron.’ ” \n   \n","“Go in peace,” said the king. So Absalom got up and went to Hebron. \n   \n","Then Absalom sent spies throughout the tribes of Israel with this message: “When you hear the sound of the horn, you are to say, ‘Absalom reigns in Hebron!’” \n   \n","Two hundred men from Jerusalem accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and they went along innocently, for they knew nothing about the matter. \n","While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, to come from his hometown of Giloh. \n  So the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept increasing. \n   \n","Then a messenger came to David and reported, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.” \n   \n","And David said to all the servants with him in Jerusalem, “Arise and let us flee, or we will not escape from Absalom! We must leave quickly, or he will soon overtake us, heap disaster on us, and put the city to the sword.” \n   \n","The king’s servants replied, “Whatever our lord the king decides, we are your servants.” \n   \n","Then the king set out, and his entire household followed him. But he left behind ten concubines to take care of the palace. \n   \n","So the king set out with all the people following him. He stopped at the last house, \n","and all his servants marched past him—all the Cherethites and Pelethites, and six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath. \n   \n","Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you also go with us? Go back and stay with the new king, since you are both a foreigner and an exile from your homeland. \n","In fact, you arrived only yesterday; should I make you wander around with us today while I do not know where I am going? Go back and take your brothers with you. May the LORD show you loving devotion and faithfulness. ” \n   \n","But Ittai answered the king, “As surely as the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be!” \n   \n","“March on then,” said David to Ittai. So Ittai the Gittite marched past with all his men and all the little ones who were with him. \n   \n","Everyone in the countryside was weeping loudly as all the people passed by. And as the king crossed the Kidron Valley, all the people also passed toward the way of the wilderness. \n   \n","Zadok was also there, and all the Levites with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices  until the people had passed out of the city. \n   \n","Then the king said to Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back and let me see both it and His dwelling place again. \n","But if He should say, ‘I do not delight in you,’ then here I am; let Him do to me whatever seems good to Him.” \n   \n","The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer?  Return to the city in peace—you with your son Ahimaaz, and Abiathar with his son Jonathan. \n","See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.” \n   \n","So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and stayed there. \n   \n","But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went up. His head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. And all the people with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went. \n   \n","Now someone told David: “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” \n  So David pleaded, “O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!” \n   \n","When David came to the summit, where he used to worship God, Hushai the Archite was there to meet him with his robe torn and dust on his head. \n   \n","David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me. \n","But you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me if you return to the city and say to Absalom: ‘I will be your servant, my king; in the past I was your father’s servant, but now I will be your servant.’ \n   \n","Will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be there with you? Report to them everything you hear from the king’s palace. \n","Indeed, their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with everything you hear.” \n   \n","So David’s friend Hushai arrived in Jerusalem just as Absalom was entering the city. \n"],["When David had gone a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him. He had a pair of saddled donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine. \n   \n","“Why do you have these?” asked the king. \n  Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness.” \n   \n","“Where is your master’s grandson?” asked the king. \n  And Ziba answered, “Indeed, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he has said, ‘Today, the house of Israel will restore to me the kingdom of my grandfather.’” \n   \n","So the king said to Ziba, “All that belongs to Mephibosheth is now yours!” \n  “I humbly bow before you,” said Ziba. “May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king!” \n   \n","As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the family of the house of Saul was just coming out. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and as he approached, he kept yelling out curses. \n","He threw stones at David and at all the servants of the king, though the troops and all the mighty men were on David’s right and left. \n   \n","And as he yelled curses, Shimei said, “Get out, get out, you worthless man of bloodshed! \n","The LORD has paid you back for all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, you have come to ruin because you are a man of bloodshed!” \n   \n","Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!” \n   \n","But the king replied, “What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah? If he curses me because the LORD told him, ‘Curse David,’ who can ask, ‘Why did you do this?’” \n   \n","Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my own son, my own flesh and blood, seeks my life. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone and let him curse me, for the LORD has told him so. \n","Perhaps the LORD will see my affliction and repay me with good for the cursing I receive today.” \n   \n","So David and his men proceeded along the road as Shimei went along the ridge of the hill opposite him. As Shimei went, he yelled curses, threw stones, and flung dust at David. \n","Finally, the king and all the people with him arrived, exhausted. And there he refreshed himself. \n   \n","Then Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. \n","And David’s friend Hushai the Archite went to Absalom and said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” \n   \n","“Is this the loyalty you show your friend?” Absalom replied. “Why did you not go with your friend?” \n   \n","“Not at all,” Hushai answered. “For the one chosen by the LORD, by the people, and by all the men of Israel—his I will be, and with him I will remain. \n","Furthermore, whom should I serve if not the son? As I served in your father’s presence, so also I will serve in yours.” \n   \n","Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give me counsel. What should we do?” \n   \n","Ahithophel replied, “Sleep with your father’s concubines, whom he has left to keep the palace. When all Israel hears that you have become a stench to your father, then the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.” \n   \n","So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. \n   \n","Now in those days the advice of Ahithophel was like the consultation of the word of God. Such was the regard that both David and Absalom had for Ahithophel’s advice. \n"],["Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David. \n","I will attack him while he is weak and weary; I will throw him into a panic, and all the people with him will flee; I will strike down only the king \n","and bring all the people back to you as a bride returning to her husband. You seek the life of only one man; then all the people will be at peace.” \n   \n","This proposal seemed good to Absalom and all the elders of Israel. \n   \n","Then Absalom said, “Summon Hushai the Archite as well, and let us hear what he too has to say.” \n   \n","So Hushai came to Absalom, who told him, “Ahithophel has spoken this proposal. Should we carry it out? If not, what do you say?” \n   \n","Hushai replied, “This time the advice of Ahithophel is not sound.” \n   \n","He continued, “You know your father and his men. They are mighty men, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Moreover, your father is a man of war who will not spend the night with the troops. \n","Surely by now he is hiding in a cave or some other location. If some of your troops fall first, whoever hears of it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.’ \n","Then even the most valiant soldier with the heart of a lion will melt with fear, because all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man who has valiant men with him. \n   \n","Instead, I advise that all Israel from Dan to Beersheba—a multitude like the sand on the seashore—be gathered to you, and that you yourself lead them into battle. \n","Then we will attack David wherever we find him, and we will descend on him like dew on the ground. And of all the men with him, not even one will remain. \n   \n","If he retreats to a city, all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not even a pebble can be found.” \n   \n","Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than that of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had purposed to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom. \n   \n","So Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, “This is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is what I have advised. \n","Now send quickly and tell David, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness, but be sure to cross over. Otherwise the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up.’” \n   \n","Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, where a servant girl would come and pass along information to them. They in turn would go and inform King David, for they dared not be seen entering the city. \n","But a young man did see them and told Absalom. So the two left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it. \n","Then the man’s wife took a covering and spread it over the mouth of the well, scattering grain over it so nobody would know a thing. \n   \n","When Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house, they asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” \n  “They have crossed over the brook,” she replied. The men searched but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem. \n   \n","After the men had gone, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed up out of the well and went to inform King David, saying, “Get up and cross over the river at once, for Ahithophel has given this advice against you.” \n   \n","So David and all the people with him got up and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, there was no one left who had not crossed the Jordan. \n   \n","When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his affairs in order and hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father’s tomb. \n   \n","Then David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. \n","Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra,  the Ishmaelite   who had married Abigail,  the daughter of Nahash  and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab. \n","So the Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. \n   \n","When David came to Mahanaim, he was met by Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim. \n","They brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, as well as wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,  \n","honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd for David and his people to eat. For they said, “The people have become hungry, exhausted, and thirsty in the wilderness.” \n"],["Then David reviewed his troops and appointed over them commanders of hundreds and of thousands. \n","He sent out the troops, a third under Joab, a third under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the troops, “I will surely march out with you as well.” \n   \n","But the people pleaded, “You must not go out! For if we have to flee, they will pay no attention to us. Even if half of us die, they will not care; but you are worth ten thousand of us. It is better for now if you support us from the city.” \n   \n","“I will do whatever seems best to you,” the king replied. So he stood beside the gate, while all the troops marched out by hundreds and by thousands. \n   \n","Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.” And all the people heard the king’s orders to each of the commanders regarding Absalom. \n   \n","So David’s army marched into the field to engage Israel in the battle, which took place in the forest of Ephraim. \n","There the people of Israel were defeated by David’s servants, and the slaughter was great that day—twenty thousand men. \n","The battle spread over the whole countryside, and that day the forest devoured more people than the sword. \n   \n","Now Absalom was riding on his mule when he met the servants of David, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom’s head was caught fast in the tree. The mule under him kept going, so that he was suspended in midair. \n","When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, “I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!” \n   \n","“You just saw him!” Joab exclaimed. “Why did you not strike him to the ground right there? I would have given you ten shekels of silver  and a warrior’s belt!” \n   \n","The man replied, “Even if a thousand shekels of silver   were weighed out into my hands, I would not raise my hand against the son of the king. For we heard the king command you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake. ’ \n","If I had jeopardized my own life  —and nothing is hidden from the king—you would have abandoned me.” \n   \n","But Joab declared, “I am not going to wait like this with you!” And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak tree. \n","And ten young men who carried Joab’s armor surrounded Absalom, struck him, and killed him. \n   \n","Then Joab blew the ram’s horn, and the troops broke off their pursuit of Israel because Joab had restrained them. \n","They took Absalom, cast him into a large pit in the forest, and piled a huge mound of stones over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled, each to his home. \n   \n","During his lifetime, Absalom had set up for himself a pillar in the King’s Valley, for he had said, “I have no son to preserve the memory of my name.” So he gave the pillar his name, and to this day it is called Absalom’s Monument. \n   \n","Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and tell the king the good news that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.” \n   \n","But Joab replied, “You are not the man to take good news today. You may do it another day, but you must not do so today, because the king’s son is dead.” \n   \n","So Joab said to a Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed to Joab and took off running. \n   \n","Ahimaaz son of Zadok, however, persisted and said to Joab, “Regardless of whatever may happen, please let me also run behind the Cushite!” \n  “My son,” Joab replied, “why do you want to run, since you will not receive a reward?” \n   \n","“No matter what, I want to run!” he replied. \n  “Then run!” Joab told him. \n  So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain  and outran the Cushite. \n   \n","Now David was sitting between the two gates when the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall, looked out, and saw a man running alone. \n","So he called out and told the king. \n  “If he is alone,” the king replied, “he bears good news.” \n  As the first runner drew near, \n","the watchman saw another man running, and he called out to the gatekeeper, “Look! Another man is running alone!” \n  “This one also brings good news,” said the king. \n   \n","The watchman said, “The first man appears to me to be running like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.” \n  “This is a good man,” said the king. “He comes with good news.” \n   \n","Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All is well!” And he bowed facedown before the king. \n  He continued, “Blessed be the LORD your God! He has delivered up the men who raised their hands against my lord the king.” \n   \n","The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom all right?” \n  And Ahimaaz replied, “When Joab sent the king’s servant and your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I do not know what it was.” \n   \n","“Move aside,” said the king, “and stand here.” \n  So he stepped aside. \n   \n","Just then the Cushite came and said, “May my lord the king hear the good news: Today the LORD has avenged you of all who rose up against you!” \n   \n","The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom all right?” \n  And the Cushite replied, “May what has become of the young man happen to the enemies of my lord the king and to all who rise up against you to harm you.” \n   \n","The king was shaken and went up to the gate chamber and wept. And as he walked, he cried out, “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!” \n"],["Then it was reported to Joab, “The king is weeping and mourning over Absalom.” \n","And that day’s victory was turned into mourning for all the people, because on that day they were told, “The king is grieving over his son.” \n   \n","So they returned to the city quietly that day, as people steal away in humiliation after fleeing a battle. \n","But the king covered his face and cried out at the top of his voice, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!” \n   \n","Then Joab went into the house and said to the king, “Today you have disgraced all your servants who have saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, of your wives, and of your concubines. \n","You love those who hate you and hate those who love you! For you have made it clear today that the commanders and soldiers mean nothing to you. I know today that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, it would have pleased you! \n   \n","Now therefore get up! Go out and speak comfort to your servants, for I swear by the LORD that if you do not go out, not a man will remain with you tonight. This will be worse for you than all the adversity that has befallen you from your youth until now!” \n   \n","So the king got up and sat in the gate, and all the people were told: “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” So they all came before the king. \n  Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled, each man to his home. \n","And all the people throughout the tribes of Israel were arguing, “The king rescued us from the hand of our enemies and delivered us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled the land because of Absalom. \n","But Absalom, the man we anointed over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about restoring the king?” \n   \n","Then King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: “Say to the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to restore the king to his palace, since the talk of all Israel has reached the king at his quarters? \n","You are my brothers, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to restore the king?’ \n","And say to Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my flesh and blood? May God punish me, and ever so severely, if from this time you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab!’” \n   \n","So he swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man, and they sent word to the king: “Return, you and all your servants.” \n   \n","So the king returned, and when he arrived at the Jordan, the men of Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across the Jordan. \n   \n","Then Shimei son of Gera, a Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David, \n","along with a thousand men of Benjamin, as well as Ziba the steward of the house of Saul and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. \n  They rushed down to the Jordan before the king \n","and crossed at the ford to carry over the king’s household and to do what was good in his sight. \n  When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell down before the king \n","and said, “My lord, do not hold me guilty, and do not remember your servant’s wrongdoing on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king not take it to heart. \n","For your servant knows that I have sinned, so here I am today as the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.” \n   \n","But Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s anointed?” \n   \n","And David replied, “Sons of Zeruiah, what have I to do with you, that you should be my adversaries today? Should any man be put to death in Israel today? Am I not indeed aware that today I am king over Israel?” \n   \n","So the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king swore an oath to him. \n   \n","Then Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, went down to meet the king. He had not cared for his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king had left until the day he returned safely. \n","And he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, who asked him, “Mephibosheth, why did you not go with me?” \n   \n","“My lord the king,” he replied, “because I am lame, I said, ‘I will have my donkey saddled  so that I may ride on it and go with the king.’ But my servant Ziba deceived me, \n","and he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. \n  Yet my lord the king is like the angel  of God, so do what is good in your eyes. \n","For all the house of my grandfather deserves death from my lord the king, yet you have set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right, then, do I have to keep appealing to the king?” \n   \n","The king replied, “Why say any more? I hereby declare that you and Ziba are to divide the land.” \n   \n","And Mephibosheth said to the king, “Instead, since my lord the king has safely come to his own house, let Ziba take it all!” \n   \n","Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and send him on his way from there. \n","Barzillai was quite old, eighty years of age, and since he was a very wealthy man, he had provided for the king while he stayed in Mahanaim. \n   \n","The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me, and I will provide for you at my side in Jerusalem.” \n   \n","But Barzillai replied, “How many years of my life remain, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king? \n","I am now eighty years old. Can I discern what is good and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or drinks? Can I still hear the voice of singing men and women? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? \n   \n","Your servant could go with the king only a short distance past the Jordan; why should the king repay me with such a reward? \n","Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your sight.” \n   \n","The king replied, “Chimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good in your sight, and I will do for you whatever you desire of me.” \n   \n","So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and Barzillai returned home. \n   \n","Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham crossed over with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel escorted the king. \n   \n","Soon all the men of Israel came to the king and asked, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, take you away secretly and bring the king and his household across the Jordan, together with all of David’s men?” \n   \n","And all the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, “We did this because the king is our relative. Why does this anger you?

That is the noise you hear. \n   \n","Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne. \n   \n","The king’s servants have also gone to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than your own name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne.’ \n  And the king has bowed in worship on his bed, \n","saying, ‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel! Today He has provided one  to sit on my throne, and my eyes have seen it.’” \n   \n","At this, all the guests of Adonijah arose in terror and scattered. \n","But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, got up and went to take hold of the horns of the altar. \n   \n","It was reported to Solomon: “Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon first swear to me not to put his servant to the sword.’” \n   \n","And Solomon replied, “If he is a man of character, not a single hair of his will fall to the ground. But if evil is found in him, he will die.” \n   \n","So King Solomon summoned Adonijah down from the altar, and he came and bowed down before King Solomon, who said to him, “Go to your home.” \n"],["As the time drew near for David to die, he charged his son Solomon, \n","“I am about to go the way of all the earth. So be strong and prove yourself a man. \n","And keep the charge of the LORD your God to walk in His ways and to keep His statutes, commandments, ordinances, and decrees, as is written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you turn, \n","and so that the LORD may fulfill His promise to me: ‘If your descendants take heed to walk faithfully before Me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’ \n   \n","Moreover, you know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me—what he did to Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether,  the two commanders of the armies of Israel. He killed them in peacetime to avenge the blood of war. He stained with the blood of war the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. \n","So act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace. \n   \n","But show loving devotion  to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, because they stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom. \n   \n","Keep an eye on Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim who is with you. He called down bitter curses against me on the day I went to Mahanaim, but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: ‘I will never put you to the sword.’ \n","Now therefore, do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You know what you ought to do to him to bring his gray head down to Sheol in blood.” \n   \n","Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. \n","The length of David’s reign over Israel was forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. \n   \n","So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was firmly established. \n   \n","Now Adonijah son of Haggith went to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, and she asked, “Do you come in peace?” \n  “Yes, in peace,” he replied. \n","Then he said, “I have something to tell you.” \n  “Say it,” she answered. \n   \n","“You know that the kingship was mine,” he said. “All Israel expected that I should reign, but the kingship has turned to my brother, for it has come to him from the LORD. \n","So now I have just one request of you; do not deny me.” \n  “State your request,” she told him. \n   \n","Adonijah replied, “Please speak to King Solomon, since he will not turn you down. Let him give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.” \n   \n","“Very well,” Bathsheba replied. “I will speak to the king for you.” \n   \n","So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. The king stood up to greet her, bowed to her, and sat down on his throne. Then the king had a throne brought for his mother, who sat down at his right hand. \n   \n","“I have just one small request of you,” she said. “Do not deny me.” \n  “Make your request, my mother,” the king replied, “for I will not deny you.” \n   \n","So Bathsheba said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife.” \n   \n","King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Since he is my older brother, you might as well request the kingdom for him and for Abiathar the priest and for Joab son of Zeruiah!” \n   \n","Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if Adonijah has not made this request at the expense of his life. \n","And now, as surely as the LORD lives—the One who established me, who set me on the throne of my father David, and who founded for me a dynasty as He promised—surely Adonijah shall be put to death today!” \n   \n","So King Solomon sent the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who struck down Adonijah, and he died. \n   \n","Then the king said to Abiathar the priest, “Go back to your fields in Anathoth. Even though you deserve to die, I will not put you to death at this time, since you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and you suffered through all that my father suffered.” \n","So Solomon banished Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD and thus fulfilled the word that the LORD had spoken at Shiloh against the house of Eli. \n   \n","When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah but not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar. \n   \n","It was reported to King Solomon: “Joab has fled to the tent of the LORD and is now beside the altar.” \n  So Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down!” \n   \n","And Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!’” \n  But Joab replied, “No, I will die here.” \n  So Benaiah relayed the message to the king, saying, “This is how Joab answered me.” \n   \n","And the king replied, “Do just as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so remove from me and from the house of my father the innocent blood that Joab shed. \n","The LORD will bring his bloodshed back upon his own head, for without the knowledge of my father David he struck down two men more righteous and better than he when he put to the sword Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army. \n","Their blood will come back upon the heads of Joab and his descendants forever; but for David, his descendants, his house, and his throne, there shall be peace from the LORD forever.” \n   \n","So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, struck down Joab, and killed him. He was buried at his own home in the wilderness. \n","And the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada in Joab’s place over the army, and he appointed Zadok the priest in Abiathar’s place. \n   \n","Then the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else. \n","On the day you go out and cross the Kidron Valley, know for sure that you will die; your blood will be on your own head.” \n   \n","“The sentence is fair,” Shimei replied. “Your servant will do as my lord the king has spoken.” And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time. \n   \n","After three years, however, two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. And Shimei was told, “Look, your slaves are in Gath.” \n   \n","So Shimei saddled his donkey and set out to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves, and he brought them back from Gath. \n   \n","When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, \n","the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, ‘On the day you leave and go elsewhere, know for sure that you will die’? And you told me, ‘The sentence is fair; I will comply.’ \n","So why have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the command that I gave you?” \n   \n","The king also said, “You know in your heart all the evil that you did to my father David. Therefore the LORD will bring your evil back upon your head. \n","But King Solomon will be blessed and David’s throne will remain secure before the LORD forever.” \n   \n","Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down, and he died. Thus the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of Solomon. \n"],["Later, Solomon formed an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt by marrying his daughter. Solomon brought her to the City of David until he had finished building his palace and the house of the LORD, as well as the wall around Jerusalem. \n   \n","The people, however, were still sacrificing on the high places because a house for the Name of the LORD had not yet been built. \n","And Solomon loved the LORD and walked in the statutes of his father David, except that he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. \n   \n","Now the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for it was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on the altar there. \n   \n","One night at Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream, and God said, “Ask, and I will give it to you!” \n   \n","Solomon replied, “You have shown much loving devotion to Your servant, my father David, because he walked before You in faithfulness, righteousness, and uprightness of heart. And You have maintained this loving devotion by giving him a son to sit on his throne this very day. \n   \n","And now, O LORD my God, You have made Your servant king in my father David’s place. But I am only a little child, not knowing how to go out or come in. \n","Your servant is here among the people You have chosen, a people too numerous to count or number. \n   \n","Therefore give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people and to discern between good and evil. For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?” \n   \n","Now it pleased the Lord  that Solomon had made this request. \n","So God said to him, “Since you have asked for this instead of requesting long life or wealth for yourself or death for your enemies—but you have asked for discernment to administer justice—\n","behold, I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has never been nor will ever be another like you. \n   \n","Moreover, I will give you what you did not request—both riches and honor—so that during all your days no man in any kingdom will be your equal. \n","So if you walk in My ways and keep My statutes and commandments, just as your father David did, I will prolong your days.” \n   \n","Then Solomon awoke, and indeed it had been a dream. So he returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then he held a feast for all his servants. \n   \n","At that time two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. \n   \n","One woman said, “Please, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth while she was in the house. \n","On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also had a baby. We were alone, with no one in the house but the two of us. \n","During the night this woman’s son died because she rolled over on him. \n","So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I was asleep. She laid him in her bosom and put her dead son at my bosom. \n","The next morning, when I got up to nurse my son, I discovered he was dead. But when I examined him, I realized that he was not the son I had borne.” \n   \n","“No,” said the other woman, “the living one is my son and the dead one is your son.” \n  But the first woman insisted, “No, the dead one is yours and the living one is mine.” So they argued before the king. \n   \n","Then the king replied, “This woman says, ‘My son is alive and yours is dead,’ but that woman says, ‘No, your son is dead and mine is alive.’” \n   \n","The king continued, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought him a sword, \n","and the king declared, “Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.” \n   \n","Then the woman whose son was alive spoke to the king because she yearned with compassion for her son. “Please, my lord,” she said, “give her the living baby. Do not kill him!” \n  But the other woman said, “He will be neither mine nor yours. Cut him in two!” \n   \n","Then the king gave his ruling: “Give the living baby to the first woman. By no means should you kill him; she is his mother.” \n   \n","When all Israel heard of the judgment the king had given, they stood in awe of him, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice. \n"],["So King Solomon ruled over Israel, \n","and these were his chief officials: \n  Azariah son of Zadok was the priest; \n   \n","Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, were secretaries; \n  Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder; \n   \n","Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of the army; \n  Zadok and Abiathar were priests; \n   \n","Azariah son of Nathan was in charge of the governors; \n  Zabud son of Nathan was a priest and adviser to the king; \n   \n","Ahishar was in charge of the palace; \n  and Adoniram  son of Abda was in charge of the forced labor. \n   \n","Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel to provide food for the king and his household.

These kingdoms offered tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life. \n   \n","Solomon’s provisions for a single day were thirty cors of fine flour,  sixty cors of meal, \n","ten fat oxen, twenty range oxen, and a hundred sheep, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened poultry. \n","For Solomon had dominion over everything west of the Euphrates  —over all the kingdoms from Tiphsah to Gaza—and he had peace on all sides. \n","Throughout the days of Solomon, Judah and Israel dwelt securely from Dan to Beersheba, each man under his own vine and his own fig tree. \n   \n","Solomon had 4,000   stalls for his chariot horses and 12,000 horses. \n","Each month the governors in turn provided food for King Solomon and all who came to his table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking. \n","Each one also brought to the required place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and other horses. \n   \n","And God gave Solomon wisdom, exceedingly deep insight, and understanding beyond measure, like the sand on the seashore. \n","Solomon’s wisdom was greater than that of all the men of the East, greater than all the wisdom of Egypt. \n","He was wiser than all men—wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and wiser than Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread throughout the surrounding nations. \n   \n","Solomon composed three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered a thousand and five. \n","He spoke of trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing in the wall, and he taught about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. \n   \n","So men of all nations came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, sent by all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom. \n"],["Now when Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king in his father’s place, he sent envoys to Solomon; for Hiram had always been a friend of David. \n   \n","And Solomon relayed this message to Hiram: \n   \n","“As you are well aware, due to the wars waged on all sides against my father David, he could not build a house for the Name of the LORD his God until the LORD had put his enemies under his feet. \n","But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no adversary or crisis. \n   \n","So behold, I plan to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God, according to what the LORD said to my father David: ‘I will put your son on your throne in your place, and he will build the house for My Name.’ \n   \n","Now therefore, order that cedars of Lebanon be cut down for me. My servants will be with your servants, and I will pay your servants whatever wages you set, for you know that there are none among us as skilled in logging as the Sidonians.” \n   \n","When Hiram received Solomon’s message, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the LORD this day! He has given David a wise son over this great people!” \n","Then Hiram sent a reply to Solomon, saying: \n  “I have received your message; I will do all you desire regarding the cedar and cypress  timber. \n","My servants will haul the logs from Lebanon to the Sea, and I will float them as rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate the logs, and you can take them away. And in exchange, you can meet my needs by providing my household with food.” \n   \n","So Hiram provided Solomon with all the cedar and cypress timber he wanted, \n","and year after year Solomon would provide Hiram with 20,000 cors of wheat   as food for his household, as well as 20,000 baths of pure olive oil. \n   \n","And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He had promised him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty. \n   \n","Then King Solomon conscripted a labor force of 30,000 men from all Israel. \n","He sent them to Lebanon in monthly shifts of 10,000 men, so that they would spend one month in Lebanon and two months at home. And Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. \n   \n","Solomon had 70,000 porters and 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, \n","not including his 3,300  foremen who supervised the workers. \n   \n","And the king commanded them to quarry large, costly stones to lay the foundation of the temple with dressed stones. \n","So Solomon’s and Hiram’s builders, along with the Gebalites, quarried the stone and prepared the timber and stone for the construction of the temple. \n"],["In the four hundred and eightieth   year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt, in the month of Ziv, the second month of the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, he began to build the house of the LORD. \n   \n","The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. \n","The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple was twenty cubits   long, extending across the width of the temple and projecting out ten cubits  in front of the temple. \n   \n","He also had narrow windows framed high in the temple. \n   \n","Against the walls of the temple and the inner sanctuary, Solomon built a chambered structure around the temple, in which he constructed the side rooms. \n","The bottom floor was five cubits wide,  the middle floor six cubits,  and the third floor seven cubits. He also placed offset ledges around the outside of the temple, so that nothing would be inserted into its walls. \n   \n","The temple was constructed using finished stones cut at the quarry, so that no hammer or chisel or any other iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built. \n   \n","The entrance to the bottom  floor was on the south side of the temple. A stairway led up to the middle level, and from there to the third floor. \n   \n","So Solomon built the temple and finished it, roofing it with beams and planks of cedar. \n","He built chambers all along the temple, each five cubits high and attached to the temple with beams of cedar. \n   \n","Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying: \n","“As for this temple you are building, if you walk in My statutes, carry out My ordinances, and keep all My commandments by walking in them, I will fulfill through you the promise I made to your father David. \n","And I will dwell among the Israelites and will not abandon My people Israel.” \n   \n","So Solomon built the temple and finished it. \n","He lined the interior walls with cedar paneling from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and he covered the floor with cypress  boards. \n   \n","He partitioned off the twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. \n","And the main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long. \n   \n","The cedar paneling inside the temple was carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; not a stone could be seen. \n   \n","Solomon also prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there. \n","The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar. \n   \n","So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains  across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold. \n","So he overlaid with gold the whole interior of the temple, until everything was completely finished. He also overlaid with gold the entire altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary. \n   \n","In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim, each ten cubits high, out of olive wood. \n","One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing was five cubits long as well. So the full wingspan was ten cubits. \n","The second cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same size and shape, \n","and the height of each cherub was ten cubits. \n   \n","And he placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple. Since their wings were spread out, the wing of the first cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the second cherub touched the other wall, and in the middle of the room their wingtips touched. \n","He also overlaid the cherubim with gold. \n   \n","Then he carved the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer sanctuaries, with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. \n","And he overlaid the temple floor with gold in both the inner and outer sanctuaries. \n   \n","For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, Solomon constructed doors of olive wood with five-sided doorposts. \n","The double doors were made of olive wood, and he carved into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold. \n   \n","In the same way he made four-sided doorposts of olive wood for the sanctuary entrance. \n","The two doors were made of cypress wood, and each had two folding panels. \n","He carved into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold, hammered evenly over the carvings. \n   \n","Solomon built the inner courtyard with three rows of dressed stone and one row of trimmed cedar beams. \n   \n","The foundation of the house of the LORD was laid in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, in the month of Ziv. \n","In his eleventh year and eighth month, the month of Bul, the temple was finished in every detail and according to every specification. So he built the temple in seven years. \n"],["Solomon, however, took thirteen years to complete the construction of his entire palace. \n   \n","He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high, with four rows of cedar pillars supporting the cedar beams. \n   \n","The house was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the pillars—forty-five beams, fifteen per row. \n","There were three rows of high windows facing one another in three tiers. \n","All the doorways  had rectangular frames, with the openings facing one another in three tiers. \n   \n","Solomon made his colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide, with a portico in front of it and a canopy with pillars in front of the portico. \n   \n","In addition, he built a hall for the throne, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge. It was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling. \n   \n","And the palace where Solomon would live, set further back, was of similar construction. He also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married. \n   \n","All these buildings were constructed with costly stones, cut to size and trimmed with saws inside and out from the foundation to the eaves, and from the outside to the great courtyard. \n","The foundations were laid with large, costly stones, some ten cubits long   and some eight cubits long. \n","Above these were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams. \n   \n","The great courtyard was surrounded by three rows of dressed stone and a row of trimmed cedar beams, as were the inner courtyard and portico of the house of the LORD. \n   \n","Now King Solomon sent to bring Huram  from Tyre. \n","He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a craftsman in bronze. Huram had great skill, understanding, and knowledge for every kind of bronze work. So he came to King Solomon and carried out all his work. \n   \n","He cast two pillars of bronze, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference. \n","He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on top of the pillars, each capital five cubits high. \n","For the capitals on top of the pillars he made a network of lattice, with wreaths of chainwork, seven for each capital. \n   \n","Likewise, he made the pillars with two rows of pomegranates around each grating to cover each capital atop the pillars. \n","And the capitals atop the pillars in the portico were shaped like lilies, four cubits high. \n","On the capitals of both pillars, just above the rounded projection next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows encircling each capital. \n   \n","Thus he set up the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jachin,  and the pillar to the north he named Boaz. \n","And the tops of the pillars were shaped like lilies. So the work of the pillars was completed. \n   \n","He also made the Sea of cast metal. It was circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim, five cubits in height, and thirty cubits in circumference. \n","Below the rim, ornamental buds encircled it, ten per cubit all the way around the Sea, cast in two rows as a part of the Sea. \n   \n","The Sea stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The Sea rested on them, with all their hindquarters toward the center. \n","It was a handbreadth thick,  and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold two thousand baths. \n   \n","In addition, he made ten movable stands of bronze, each four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high. \n   \n","This was the design of the stands: They had side panels attached to uprights, \n","and on the panels between the uprights were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the uprights was a pedestal above, and below the lions and oxen were wreaths of beveled work. \n   \n","Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles and a basin resting on four supports, with wreaths at each side. \n","The opening to each stand inside the crown at the top was one cubit deep,  with a round opening like the design of a pedestal, a cubit and a half wide. And around its opening were engravings, but the panels of the stands were square, not round. \n   \n","There were four wheels under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand; each wheel was a cubit and a half in diameter. \n","The wheels were made like chariot wheels; their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all of cast metal. \n   \n","Each stand had four handles, one for each corner, projecting from the stand. \n","At the top of each stand was a circular band half a cubit high. The supports and panels were cast as a unit with the top of the stand. \n   \n","He engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and panels, wherever each had space, with wreaths all around. \n","In this way he made the ten stands, each with the same casting, dimensions, and shape. \n   \n","He also made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths  and measuring four cubits across, one basin for each of the ten stands. \n   \n","He set five stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north, and he put the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple. \n   \n","Additionally, Huram made the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls. \n  So Huram finished all the work that he had undertaken for King Solomon in the house of the LORD: \n   \n","the two pillars; \n  the two bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars; \n  the two sets of network covering both bowls of the capitals atop the pillars; \n   \n","the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network covering both the bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars); \n   \n","the ten stands; \n  the ten basins on the stands; \n   \n","the Sea; \n  the twelve oxen underneath the Sea; \n   \n","and the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls. \n  All the articles that Huram made for King Solomon in the house of the LORD were made of burnished bronze. \n","The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan. \n","Solomon left all these articles unweighed, because there were so many. The weight of the bronze could not be determined. \n   \n","Solomon also made all the furnishings for the house of the LORD: \n  the golden altar; \n  the golden table on which was placed the Bread of the Presence; \n   \n","the lampstands of pure gold in front of the inner sanctuary, five on the right side and five on the left; \n  the gold flowers, lamps, and tongs; \n   \n","the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, ladles, and censers; \n  and the gold hinges for the doors of the inner temple (that is, the Most Holy Place  ) as well as for the doors of the main hall of the temple. \n   \n","So all the work that King Solomon had performed for the house of the LORD was completed. \n  Then Solomon brought in the items his father David had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD. \n"],["At that time Solomon assembled before him in Jerusalem the elders of Israel—all the tribal heads and family leaders of the Israelites—to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Zion, the City of David. \n","And all the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the feast in the seventh month,  the month of Ethanim. \n   \n","When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark, \n","and they brought up the ark of the LORD and the Tent of Meeting with all its sacred furnishings. So the priests and Levites carried them up. \n   \n","There, before the ark, King Solomon and the whole congregation of Israel who had assembled with him sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered. \n   \n","Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim. \n","For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its poles. \n   \n","The poles extended far enough that their ends were visible from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are there to this day. \n   \n","There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites after they had come out of the land of Egypt. \n   \n","And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, the cloud filled the house of the LORD \n","so that the priests could not stand there to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD. \n   \n","Then Solomon declared: \n  “The LORD  has said that He would dwell \n in the thick cloud. \n  \n","I have indeed built You an exalted house, \n a place for You to dwell forever.” \n   \n","And as the whole assembly of Israel stood there, the king turned around and blessed them all \n","and said: \n  “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His own hand what He spoke with His mouth to my father David, saying, \n","‘Since the day I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house so that My Name would be there. But I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’ \n   \n","Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel. \n","But the LORD said to my father David, ‘Since it was in your heart to build a house for My Name, you have done well to have this in your heart. \n","Nevertheless, you are not the one to build it; but your son, your own offspring, will build the house for My Name.’ \n   \n","Now the LORD has fulfilled the word that He spoke. I have succeeded my father David, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised. I have built the house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel. \n","And there I have provided a place for the ark, which contains the covenant of the LORD that He made with our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.” \n   \n","Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven, \n","and said: \n  “O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth below, keeping Your covenant of loving devotion with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts. \n","You have kept Your promise to Your servant, my father David. What You spoke with Your mouth You have fulfilled with Your hand this day. \n   \n","Therefore now, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for Your servant, my father David, what You promised when You said: ‘You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants guard their way to walk before Me as you have done.’ \n","And now, O God of Israel, please confirm what You promised to Your servant, my father David. \n   \n","But will God indeed dwell upon the earth? Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain You, much less this temple I have built. \n","Yet regard the prayer and plea of Your servant, O LORD my God, so that You may hear the cry and the prayer that Your servant is praying before You today. \n   \n","May Your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, toward the place of which You said, ‘My Name shall be there,’ so that You may hear the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place. \n","Hear the plea of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. May You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place. May You hear and forgive. \n   \n","When a man sins against his neighbor and is required to take an oath, and he comes to take an oath before Your altar in this temple, \n","then may You hear from heaven and act. May You judge Your servants, condemning the wicked man by bringing down on his own head what he has done, and justifying the righteous man by rewarding him according to his righteousness. \n   \n","When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they return to You and confess Your name, praying and pleading with You in this temple, \n","then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel. May You restore them to the land You gave to their fathers. \n   \n","When the skies are shut and there is no rain because Your people have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and they turn from their sins because You have afflicted them, \n","then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, so that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk. May You send rain on the land that You gave Your people as an inheritance. \n   \n","When famine or plague comes upon the land, or blight or mildew or locusts or grasshoppers, or when their enemy besieges them in their cities, whatever plague or sickness may come, \n","then may whatever prayer or petition Your people Israel make—each knowing his own afflictions and spreading out his hands toward this temple—\n","be heard by You from heaven, Your dwelling place. And may You forgive and act, and repay each man according to all his ways, since You know his heart—for You alone know the hearts of all men—\n","so that they may fear You all the days they live in the land that You gave to our fathers. \n   \n","And as for the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of Your name—\n","for they will hear of Your great name and mighty hand and outstretched arm—when he comes and prays toward this temple, \n","then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You. Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and they will know that this house I have built is called by Your Name. \n   \n","When Your people go to war against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they pray to the LORD in the direction of the city You have chosen and the house I have built for Your Name, \n","then may You hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and may You uphold their cause. \n   \n","When they sin against You—for there is no one who does not sin—and You become angry with them and deliver them to an enemy who takes them as captives to his own land, whether far or near, \n","and when they come to their senses in the land to which they were taken, and they repent and plead with You in the land of their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,’ \n","and when they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of the enemies who took them captive, and when they pray to You in the direction of the land that You gave to their fathers, the city You have chosen, and the house I have built for Your Name, \n","then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, their prayer and petition, and may You uphold their cause. \n","May You forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all the transgressions they have committed against You, and may You grant them compassion in the eyes of their captors to show them mercy. \n   \n","For they are Your people and Your inheritance; You brought them out of Egypt, out of the furnace for iron. \n","May Your eyes be open to the pleas of Your servant and of Your people Israel, and may You listen to them whenever they call to You. \n","For You, O Lord GOD, as Your inheritance, have set them apart from all the peoples of the earth, as You spoke through Your servant Moses when You brought our fathers out of Egypt.” \n   \n","Now when Solomon had finished praying this entire prayer and petition to the LORD, he got up before the altar of the LORD, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven. \n","And he stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying: \n   \n","“Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel according to all that He promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises He made through His servant Moses. \n   \n","May the LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers. May He never leave us nor forsake us. \n","May He incline our hearts to Himself, to walk in all His ways and to keep the commandments and statutes and ordinances He commanded our fathers. \n   \n","And may these words with which I have made my petition before the LORD be near to the LORD our God day and night, so that He may uphold the cause of His servant and of His people Israel as each day requires, \n","so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God. There is no other! \n   \n","So let your heart be fully devoted to the LORD our God, as it is this day, to walk in His statutes and to keep His commandments.” \n   \n","Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD. \n","And Solomon offered as peace offerings to the LORD 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the house of the LORD. \n   \n","On that same day the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard in front of the house of the LORD, and there he offered the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, since the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to contain all these offerings. \n   \n","So at that time Solomon and all Israel with him—a great assembly of people from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt—kept the feast before the LORD our God for seven days and seven more days—fourteen days in all. \n   \n","On the fifteenth day  Solomon sent the people away. So they blessed the king and went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things that the LORD had done for His servant David and for His people Israel. \n"],["Now when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the royal palace, and had achieved all that he had desired to do, \n","the LORD appeared to him a second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon. \n","And the LORD said to him: \n  “I have heard your prayer and petition before Me. I have consecrated this temple you have built by putting My Name there forever; My eyes and My heart will be there for all time. \n   \n","And as for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, with a heart of integrity and uprightness, doing all I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and ordinances, \n","then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised your father David when I said, ‘You will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’ \n   \n","But if indeed you or your sons turn away from following Me and do not keep the commandments and statutes I have set before you, and if you go off to serve and worship other gods, \n","then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them, and I will banish from My presence this temple I have sanctified for My Name. Then Israel will become an object of scorn and ridicule among all peoples. \n   \n","And when this temple has become a heap of rubble, all who pass by it will be appalled and will hiss and say, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’ \n","And others will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the LORD their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—because of this, the LORD has brought all this disaster upon them.’” \n   \n","Now at the end of the twenty years during which Solomon built these two houses, the house of the LORD and the royal palace, \n","King Solomon gave twenty towns in the land of Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, who had supplied him with cedar and cypress  logs and gold for his every desire. \n","So Hiram went out from Tyre to inspect the towns that Solomon had given him, but he was not pleased with them. \n   \n","“What are these towns you have given me, my brother?” asked Hiram, and he called them the Land of Cabul, as they are called to this day. \n   \n","And Hiram had sent the king 120 talents of gold. \n   \n","This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon imposed to build the house of the LORD, his own palace, the supporting terraces, and the wall of Jerusalem, as well as Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. \n   \n","Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. \n","So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, Lower Beth-horon, \n","Baalath, and Tamar   in the Wilderness of Judah, \n","as well as all the store cities that Solomon had for his chariots and horses  —whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion. \n   \n","As for all the people who remained of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (the people who were not Israelites)—\n","their descendants who remained in the land, those whom the Israelites were unable to devote to destruction  —Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this day. \n   \n","But Solomon did not consign any of the Israelites to slavery, because they were his men of war, his servants, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry. \n","They were also the chief officers over Solomon’s projects: 550 supervisors over the people who did the work. \n   \n","As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace that Solomon had built for her, he built the supporting terraces. \n   \n","Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense with them before the LORD. So he completed the temple. \n   \n","King Solomon also assembled a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth   in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea. \n","And Hiram sent his servants, men who knew the sea, to serve in the fleet with Solomon’s servants. \n","They sailed to Ophir and imported gold from there—420 talents  —and delivered it to Solomon. \n"],["Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with difficult questions. \n","She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan—with camels bearing spices, gold in great abundance, and precious stones. \n  So she came to Solomon and spoke to him all that was on her mind. \n","And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for the king to explain. \n   \n","When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built, \n","the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of the LORD, it took her breath away. \n   \n","She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and wisdom is true. \n","But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told to me. Your wisdom and prosperity have far exceeded the report I heard. \n","How blessed are your men! How blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom! \n","Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel. Because of the LORD’s eternal love for Israel, He has made you king to carry out justice and righteousness.” \n   \n","Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again was such an abundance of spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. \n   \n","(The fleet of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir also brought from Ophir a great cargo of almug  wood and precious stones. \n","The king made the almug wood into steps for the house of the LORD and for the king’s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers. Never before had such almug wood been brought in, nor has such been seen to this day.) \n   \n","King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired—whatever she asked—besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned to her own country, along with her servants. \n   \n","The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was 666 talents, \n","not including the revenue from the merchants, traders, and all the Arabian kings and governors of the land. \n   \n","King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold  went into each shield. \n","He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold  went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. \n   \n","Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. \n","The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest. \n","Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom. \n   \n","All King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon. \n","For the king had the ships of Tarshish   at sea with Hiram’s fleet, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. \n   \n","So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. \n","The whole world sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart. \n","Year after year, each visitor would bring his tribute: articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. \n   \n","Solomon accumulated   1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. \n","The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills. \n   \n","Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue; the royal merchants purchased them from Kue. \n","A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver,  and a horse for a hundred and fifty. Likewise, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram. \n"],["King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh—women of Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Sidon, as well as Hittite women. \n","These women were from the nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry with them, for surely they will turn your hearts after their gods.” Yet Solomon clung to these women in love. \n","He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines—and his wives turned his heart away. \n   \n","For when Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and he was not wholeheartedly devoted to the LORD his God, as his father David had been. \n","Solomon followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and Milcom  the abomination of the Ammonites. \n","So Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD; unlike his father David, he did not follow the LORD completely. \n   \n","At that time on a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites. \n","He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods. \n   \n","Now the LORD grew angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. \n","Although He had warned Solomon explicitly not to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD’s command. \n   \n","Then the LORD said to Solomon, “Because you have done this and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant. \n","Nevertheless, for the sake of your father David, I will not do it during your lifetime; I will tear it out of the hand of your son. \n","Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom away from him. I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.” \n   \n","Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom. \n   \n","Earlier, when David was in Edom, Joab the commander of the army had gone to bury the dead and had struck down every male in Edom. \n","Joab and all Israel had stayed there six months, until he had killed every male in Edom. \n","But Hadad, still just a young boy, had fled to Egypt, along with some Edomites who were servants of his father. \n   \n","Hadad and his men set out from Midian and went to Paran. They took men from Paran with them and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food. \n   \n","There Hadad found such great favor in the sight of Pharaoh that he gave to him in marriage the sister of Queen Tahpenes, his own wife. \n","And the sister of Tahpenes bore Hadad a son named Genubath. Tahpenes herself weaned him in Pharaoh’s palace, and Genubath lived there among the sons of Pharaoh. \n   \n","When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had rested with his fathers and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead, he said to Pharaoh, “Let me go, that I may return to my own country.” \n   \n","But Pharaoh asked him, “What have you lacked here with me that you suddenly want to go back to your own country?” \n  “Nothing,” Hadad replied, “but please let me go.” \n   \n","And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah, \n","and had gathered men to himself. When David killed the Zobaites, Rezon captained a band of raiders and went to Damascus, where they settled and gained control. \n   \n","Rezon was Israel’s enemy throughout the days of Solomon, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled over Aram with hostility toward Israel. \n   \n","Now Jeroboam son of Nebat was an Ephraimite from Zeredah whose mother was a widow named Zeruah. Jeroboam was a servant of Solomon, but he rebelled against the king, \n","and this is the account of his rebellion against the king. \n  Solomon had built the supporting terraces  and repaired the gap in the wall of the city of his father David. \n","Now Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor. So when Solomon noticed that the young man was industrious, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph. \n   \n","During that time, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met Jeroboam on the road as he was going out of Jerusalem. Now Ahijah had wrapped himself in a new cloak, and the two of them were alone in the open field. \n   \n","And Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing, tore it into twelve pieces, \n","and said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes. \n","But one tribe will remain for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. \n   \n","For they have  forsaken Me to worship Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites. They have not walked in My ways, nor done what is right in My eyes, nor kept My statutes and judgments, as Solomon’s father David did. \n   \n","Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon’s hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David My servant, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and statutes. \n","But I will take ten tribes of the kingdom from the hand of his son and give them to you. \n","I will give one tribe to his son, so that My servant David will always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put My Name. \n","But as for you, I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your heart desires, and you will be king over Israel. \n   \n","If you listen to all that I command you, walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight in order to keep My statutes and commandments as My servant David did, then I will be with you. I will build you a lasting dynasty just as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. \n","Because of this, I will humble David’s descendants—but not forever.’” \n   \n","Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, where he remained until the death of Solomon. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Solomon—all that he did, as well as his wisdom—are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon? \n","Thus the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. \n   \n","And Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. And his son Rehoboam reigned in his place. \n"],["Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king. \n","When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about this, he was still  in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon and had been living ever since. \n","So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel came to Rehoboam and said, \n","“Your father put a heavy yoke on us. But now you should lighten the burden of your father’s service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.” \n   \n","Rehoboam answered, “Go away for three days and then return to me.” So the people departed. \n   \n","Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How do you advise me to respond to these people?” he asked. \n   \n","They replied, “If you will be a servant to these people and serve them this day, and if you will respond by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.” \n   \n","But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders; instead, he consulted the young men who had grown up with him and served him. \n","He asked them, “What message do you advise that we send back to these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?” \n   \n","The young men who had grown up with him replied, “This is how you should answer these people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it lighter.’ This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist! \n","Whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.’” \n   \n","After three days, Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, since the king had said, “Come back to me on the third day.” \n","And the king answered the people harshly. He rejected the advice of the elders \n","and spoke to them as the young men had advised, saying, “Whereas my father made your yoke heavy, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.” \n   \n","So the king did not listen to the people, and indeed this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word He had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite. \n   \n","When all Israel saw that the king had refused to listen to them, they answered the king: \n  “What portion do we have in David, \n and what inheritance in the son of Jesse? \n To your tents, O Israel! \n Look now to your own house, O David!” \n  So the Israelites went home, \n","but Rehoboam still reigned over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah. \n   \n","Then King Rehoboam sent out Adoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste and escaped to Jerusalem. \n","So to this day Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David. \n   \n","When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah followed the house of David. \n   \n","And when Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mobilized the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—180,000 chosen warriors—to fight against the house of Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon. \n   \n","But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God: \n","“Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people \n","that this is what the LORD says: ‘You are not to go up and fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Each of you must return home, for this word is from Me.’” \n  So they listened to the word of the LORD and turned back according to the word of the LORD. \n   \n","Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. And from there he went out and built Penuel. \n   \n","Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom might revert to the house of David. \n","If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, their hearts will return to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah; then they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.” \n   \n","After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves and said to the people, “Going up to Jerusalem is too much for you. Here, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.” \n   \n","One calf he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan. \n","And this thing became a sin; the people walked as far as Dan to worship before one of the calves. \n   \n","Jeroboam also built shrines on the high places and appointed from every class of people priests who were not Levites. \n","And Jeroboam ordained a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar; he made this offering in Bethel to sacrifice to the calves he had set up, and he installed priests in Bethel for the high places he had set up. \n   \n","On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, Jeroboam offered sacrifices on the altar he had set up in Bethel. So he ordained a feast for the Israelites, offered sacrifices on the altar, and burned incense. \n"],["Suddenly, as Jeroboam was standing beside the altar to burn incense, there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD. \n","And he cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD, “O altar, O altar, this is what the LORD says: ‘A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David, and upon you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense upon you, and human bones will be burned upon you.’” \n   \n","That day the man of God gave a sign, saying, “The LORD has spoken this sign: ‘Surely the altar will be split apart, and the ashes upon it will be poured out.’” \n   \n","Now when King Jeroboam, who was at the altar in Bethel, heard the word that the man of God had cried out against it, he stretched out his hand and said, “Seize him!” But the hand he stretched out toward him withered, so that he could not pull it back. \n","And the altar was split apart, and the ashes poured out, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. \n   \n","Then the king responded to the man of God, “Intercede with the LORD your God and pray that my hand may be restored.” \n  So the man of God interceded with the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored to him as it was before. \n   \n","Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.” \n   \n","But the man of God replied, “If you were to give me half your possessions, I still would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place. \n","For this is what I was commanded by the word of the LORD: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.’” \n   \n","So the man of God went another way and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel. \n   \n","Now a certain old prophet was living in Bethel, and his sons  came and told him all the deeds that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the words that the man had spoken to the king. \n   \n","“Which way did he go?” their father asked. \n  And his sons showed him  the way taken by the man of God, who had come from Judah. \n","So the prophet said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” \n  Then they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it \n","and went after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree  and asked, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” \n  “I am,” he replied. \n   \n","So the prophet said to the man of God, “Come home with me and eat some bread.” \n   \n","But the man replied, “I cannot return with you or eat bread or drink water with you in this place. \n","For I have been told by the word of the LORD: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.’” \n   \n","Then the prophet replied, “I too am a prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘Bring him back with you to your house, so that he may eat bread and drink water.’” \n  The old prophet was lying to him, \n","but the man of God went back with him, ate bread in his house, and drank water. \n   \n","While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back, \n","and the prophet cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because you have defied the word of the LORD and have not kept the commandment that the LORD your God gave you, \n","but you went back and ate bread and drank water in the place where He told you not to do so, your body shall never reach the tomb of your fathers.’” \n   \n","And after the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the old prophet who had brought him back saddled the donkey for him. \n","As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was left lying in the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. \n   \n","And there were men passing by who saw the body lying in the road with the lion standing beside it, and they went and reported this in the city where the old prophet lived. \n   \n","When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard this, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the command of the LORD. Therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, and it has mauled him and killed him, according to the word that the LORD had spoken to him.” \n   \n","Then the old prophet instructed his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled it, \n","and he went and found the body lying in the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had not eaten the body or mauled the donkey. \n","So the old prophet lifted up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him. \n","Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they lamented over him, “Oh, my brother!” \n   \n","After he had buried him, the prophet said to his sons, “When I die, you must bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones, \n","for the message that he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the cities of Samaria will surely come to pass.” \n   \n","Even after these events, Jeroboam did not repent of his evil ways, but again he appointed priests for the high places from every class of people. He ordained anyone who desired to be a priest of the high places. \n","And this was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its extermination and destruction from the face of the earth. \n"],["At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill, \n","and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Now get up, disguise yourself so they will not recognize you as my wife, and go to Shiloh. For Ahijah the prophet is there; it was he who spoke about my kingship over this people. \n","Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the boy.” \n   \n","Jeroboam’s wife did as instructed; she arose and went to Shiloh and arrived at Ahijah’s house. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age. \n","But the LORD had said to Ahijah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill. You are to say such and such to her, because when she arrives, she will be disguised.” \n   \n","So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet entering the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you disguised? For I have been sent to you with bad news. \n","Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over My people Israel. \n","I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. But you were not like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart, doing only what was right in My eyes. \n   \n","You have done more evil than all who came before you. You have proceeded to make for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me, and you have flung Me behind your back. \n","Because of all this, behold, I am bringing disaster on the house of Jeroboam: \n  I will cut off from Jeroboam every male, \n both slave and free, \n in Israel; \n I will burn up the house of Jeroboam \n as one burns up dung until it is gone! \n  \n","Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city \n will be eaten by dogs, \n and anyone who dies in the field \n will be eaten by the birds of the air.’ \n For the LORD has spoken. \n   \n","As for you, get up and go home. When your feet enter the city, the child will die. \n","All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. For this is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will receive a proper burial, because only in him has the LORD, the God of Israel, found any good in the house of Jeroboam. \n   \n","Moreover, the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is the day—yes, even today! \n","For the LORD will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave their fathers, and He will scatter them beyond the Euphrates, because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking the LORD to anger. \n","So He will give Israel over on account of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.” \n   \n","Then Jeroboam’s wife got up and departed for Tirzah, and as soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died. \n","And they buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through His servant Ahijah the prophet. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he waged war and how he reigned, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. \n   \n","And the length of Jeroboam’s reign was twenty-two years, and he rested with his fathers, and his son Nadab reigned in his place. \n   \n","Meanwhile, Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel in which to put His Name. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. \n   \n","And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and by the sins they committed they provoked Him to jealous anger more than all their fathers had done. \n","They also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree. \n","There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land. They imitated all the abominations of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. \n   \n","In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign, Shishak king of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem. \n","He seized the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the royal palace. He took everything, including all the gold shields that Solomon had made. \n   \n","Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and committed them to the care of the captains of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. \n","And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards would bear the shields, and later they would return them to the guardroom. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, along with all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? \n   \n","There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their days. \n","And Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David; his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite.

His mother’s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom. \n   \n","And Abijam walked in all the sins that his father before him had committed, and his heart was not as fully devoted to the LORD his God as the heart of David his forefather had been. \n","Nevertheless, for the sake of David, the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up a son to succeed him and to make Jerusalem strong. \n","For David had done what was right in the eyes of the LORD and had not turned aside from anything the LORD commanded all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. \n   \n","And there was war between the houses of Rehoboam   and Jeroboam all the days of Abijam’s life. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Abijam, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. \n   \n","And Abijam rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David, and his son Asa reigned in his place. \n   \n","In the twentieth year of Jeroboam’s reign over Israel, Asa became king of Judah, \n","and he reigned in Jerusalem forty-one years. His grandmother’s  name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom. \n   \n","And Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as his father David had done. \n","He banished the male shrine prostitutes from the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. \n","He also removed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made a detestable Asherah pole. Asa chopped down the pole and burned it in the Kidron Valley. \n   \n","The high places were not removed, but Asa’s heart was fully devoted to the LORD all his days. \n","And he brought into the house of the LORD the silver and gold and other articles that he and his father had dedicated. \n   \n","Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their days. \n","Baasha king of Israel went to war against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah. \n   \n","So Asa withdrew all the silver and gold that remained in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the royal palace. He entrusted it to his servants and sent them with this message to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus: \n","“Let there be a treaty  between me and you, between my father and your father. See, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold. Now go and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.” \n   \n","And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and the whole land of Naphtali, including the region of Chinnereth. \n   \n","When Baasha learned of this, he stopped fortifying Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah. \n","Then King Asa summoned all the men of Judah, with no exceptions, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had used for building. And with these materials King Asa built up Geba of Benjamin, as well as Mizpah. \n   \n","Now the rest of the acts of Asa, along with all his might, all his accomplishments, and the cities he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? In his old age, however, he became diseased in his feet. \n   \n","And Asa rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of his father David, and his son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place. \n   \n","In the second year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel, and he reigned two years. \n","And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit. \n   \n","Then Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against Nadab, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon of the Philistines while Nadab and all Israel were besieging the city. \n","In the third year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Baasha killed Nadab and reigned in his place. \n   \n","As soon as Baasha became king, he struck down the entire household of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone that breathed, but destroyed them all according to the word that the LORD had spoken through His servant Ahijah the Shilonite, \n","because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit, and because he had provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Nadab, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? \n","And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their days. \n   \n","In the third year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah twenty-four years. \n   \n","And Baasha did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit. \n"],["Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha, saying: \n","“Even though I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel, you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have caused My people Israel to sin and to provoke Me to anger by their sins. \n","So now I will consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat: \n   \n","Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city \n will be eaten by dogs, \n and anyone who dies in the field \n will be eaten by the birds of the air.” \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Baasha, along with his accomplishments and might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? \n","And Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah, and his son Elah reigned in his place. \n   \n","Moreover, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, because of all the evil he had done in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands and becoming like the house of Jeroboam, and also because Baasha had struck down the house of Jeroboam. \n   \n","In the twenty-sixth year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years. \n   \n","However, while Elah was in Tirzah getting drunk in the house of Arza the steward of his household there, Elah’s servant Zimri, the commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. \n","So in the twenty-seventh year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Zimri went in, struck Elah down, and killed him.

So there in the camp that very day, all Israel proclaimed Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel. \n   \n","Then Omri and all the Israelites marched up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah. \n","When Zimri saw that the city was captured, he entered the citadel of the royal palace and burned it down upon himself.

The God who answers by fire, He is God.” \n  And all the people answered, “What you say is good.” \n   \n","Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Since you are so numerous, choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first. Then call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.” \n   \n","And they took the bull that was given them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, shouting, “O Baal, answer us!” \n  But there was no sound, and no one answered as they leaped around the altar they had made. \n   \n","At noon Elijah began to taunt them, saying, “Shout louder, for he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or occupied, or on a journey. Perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened!” \n   \n","So they shouted louder and cut themselves with knives and lances, as was their custom, until the blood gushed over them. \n   \n","Midday passed, and they kept on raving until the time of the evening sacrifice. But there was no response; no one answered, no one paid attention. \n   \n","Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people approached him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been torn down. \n   \n","And Elijah took twelve stones, one for each tribe of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come and said, “Israel shall be your name.” \n","And with the stones, Elijah built an altar in the name of the LORD. Then he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed. \n   \n","Next, he arranged the wood, cut up the bull, placed it on the wood, \n","and said, “Fill four waterpots and pour the water on the offering and on the wood.” \n  “Do it a second time,” he said, and they did it a second time. \n  “Do it a third time,” he said, and they did it a third time. \n   \n","So the water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench. \n   \n","At the time of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet approached the altar and said, “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and that I am Your servant and have done all these things at Your command. \n","Answer me, O LORD! Answer me, so that this people will know that You, the LORD, are God, and that You have turned their hearts back again.” \n   \n","Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the water in the trench. \n   \n","When all the people saw this, they fell facedown and said, “The LORD, He is God! The LORD, He is God!” \n   \n","Then Elijah ordered them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let a single one escape.” So they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered them there. \n   \n","And Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.” \n   \n","So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah climbed to the summit of Carmel, bent down on the ground, and put his face between his knees. \n","“Go and look toward the sea,” he said to his servant. \n  So the servant went and looked, and he said, “There is nothing there.” \n  Seven times Elijah said, “Go back.” \n   \n","On the seventh time the servant reported, “There is a cloud as small as a man’s hand rising from the sea.” \n  And Elijah replied, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’” \n   \n","Meanwhile, the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and a heavy rain began to fall. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel. \n   \n","And the hand of the LORD came upon Elijah, and he tucked his cloak into his belt  and ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel. \n"],["Now Ahab told Jezebel everything that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. \n","So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “May the gods deal with me, and ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like the lives of those you killed!” \n   \n","And Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, \n","while he himself traveled on a day’s journey into the wilderness. He sat down under a broom tree and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, LORD,” he said. “Take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.” \n   \n","Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep. \n  Suddenly an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.” \n   \n","And he looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank and lay down again. \n   \n","A second time the angel of the LORD returned and touched him, saying, “Get up and eat, or the journey will be too much for you.” \n   \n","So he got up and ate and drank. And strengthened by that food, he walked forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. \n   \n","There Elijah entered a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him, saying, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” \n   \n","“I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of Hosts,” he replied, “but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well.” \n   \n","Then the LORD said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD. Behold, the LORD is about to pass by.” \n  And a great and mighty wind tore into the mountains and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. \n  After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. \n   \n","After the earthquake there was a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. \n  And after the fire came a still, small voice. \n","When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Suddenly a voice came to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” \n   \n","“I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of Hosts,” he replied, “but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well.” \n   \n","Then the LORD said to him, “Go back by the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you arrive, you are to anoint Hazael as king over Aram. \n","You are also to anoint Jehu son  of Nimshi as king over Israel and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah to succeed you as prophet. \n   \n","Then Jehu will put to death whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death whoever escapes the sword of Jehu. \n   \n","Nevertheless, I have reserved seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed to Baal  and whose mouths have not kissed him.” \n   \n","So Elijah departed and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve teams of oxen, and he was with the twelfth team. Elijah passed by him and threw his cloak around him. \n   \n","So Elisha left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, and then I will follow you.” \n  “Go on back,” Elijah replied, “for what have I done to you?” \n   \n","So Elisha turned back from him, took his pair of oxen, and slaughtered them. With the oxen’s equipment, he cooked the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow and serve Elijah. \n"],["Now Ben-hadad king of Aram assembled his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots, he marched up, besieged Samaria, and waged war against it. \n","Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, \n","saying, “This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘Your silver and gold are mine, and your best wives and children are mine!’” \n   \n","And the king of Israel replied, “Just as you say, my lord the king: I am yours, along with all that I have.” \n   \n","The messengers came back and said, “This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘I have sent to you to demand your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children. \n","But about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to search your palace and the houses of your servants. They will seize and carry away all that is precious to you.’” \n   \n","Then the king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said, “Please take note and see that this man is looking for trouble, for when he demanded my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold, I did not deny him.” \n   \n","And the elders and the people all said, “Do not listen to him or consent to his terms.” \n   \n","So Ahab answered the messengers of Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you demanded of your servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’” \n  So the messengers departed and relayed the message to Ben-hadad. \n   \n","Then Ben-hadad sent another message to Ahab: “May the gods deal with me, and ever so severely, if enough dust remains of Samaria for each of my men to have a handful.” \n   \n","And the king of Israel replied, “Tell him: ‘The one putting on his armor should not boast like one taking it off.’” \n   \n","Ben-hadad received this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents, and he said to his servants, “Take your positions.” So they stationed themselves against the city. \n   \n","Meanwhile a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Do you see this entire great army? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand this very day, and you will know that I am the LORD.’” \n   \n","“By whom?” Ahab asked. \n  And the prophet replied, “This is what the LORD says: ‘By the young officers of the district governors.’” \n  “Who will start the battle?” asked Ahab. \n  “You will,” answered the prophet. \n   \n","So Ahab assembled the young officers of the district governors, and there were 232 men. And after them, he assembled the rest of the Israelite troops, 7,000 in all. \n   \n","They marched out at noon while Ben-hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk. \n","And the young officers of the district governors marched out first. \n  Now Ben-hadad had sent out scouts, who reported to him, “Men are marching out of Samaria.” \n   \n","“If they have marched out in peace,” he said, “take them alive. Even if they have marched out for war, take them alive.” \n   \n","Meanwhile, these young officers of the district governors marched out of the city, with the army behind them, \n","and each one struck down his opponent. So the Arameans fled, with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with the cavalry. \n   \n","Then the king of Israel marched out and attacked the horses and chariots, inflicting a great slaughter on the Arameans. \n   \n","Afterward, the prophet approached the king of Israel and said, “Go and strengthen your position, and take note what you must do, for in the spring  the king of Aram will come up against you.” \n   \n","Meanwhile, the servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they prevailed over us. Instead, we should fight them on the plains; surely then we will prevail. \n","So do this: Dismiss all the kings from their positions and replace them with other officers. \n","And you must raise an army like the one you have lost—horse for horse and chariot for chariot—so we can fight the Israelites on the plain, where we will surely prevail.” \n  And the king approved their plan and acted accordingly. \n   \n","In the spring, Ben-hadad mobilized the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. \n","The Israelites also mobilized, gathered supplies, and marched out to meet them. \n  The Israelites camped before them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside. \n   \n","Then the man of God approached the king of Israel and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because the Arameans think the LORD is a god of the hills and not of the valleys, I will deliver all this great army into your hand. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’” \n   \n","For seven days the armies camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle ensued, and the Israelites struck down the Arameans—a hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day. \n   \n","The rest of them fled into the city of Aphek, where the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the remaining men. Ben-hadad also fled to the city and hid in an inner room. \n   \n","Then the servants of Ben-hadad said to him, “Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful. Let us go out to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads.

He is my brother.” \n   \n","Now the men were looking for a sign of hope, and they quickly grasped at this word and replied, “Yes, your brother Ben-hadad.” \n  “Go and get him!” said the king. \n  Then Ben-hadad came out, and Ahab had him come up into his chariot. \n   \n","Ben-hadad said to him, “I will restore the cities my father took from your father; you may set up your own marketplaces in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.” \n  “By this treaty  I release you,” Ahab replied. So he made a treaty with him and sent him away. \n   \n","Meanwhile, by the word of the LORD, one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion, “Strike me, please!” \n  But the man refused to strike him. \n   \n","Then the prophet said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, as soon as you depart from me a lion will kill you.” \n  And when he left, a lion found him and killed him. \n   \n","Then the prophet found another man and said, “Strike me, please!” \n  So the man struck him and wounded him, \n","and the prophet went and waited on the road for the king, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes. \n   \n","As the king passed by, he cried out to the king: “Your servant had marched out into the middle of the battle, when suddenly a man came over with a captive and told me, ‘Guard this man! If he goes missing for any reason, your life will be exchanged for his life, or you will weigh out a talent of silver. ’ \n","But while your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared.” \n  And the king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you have pronounced it on yourself.” \n   \n","Then the prophet quickly removed the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. \n   \n","And the prophet said to the king, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because you have let slip from your hand the man I had devoted to destruction, your life will be exchanged for his life, and your people for his people.’” \n   \n","Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went home to Samaria. \n"],["Some time later, Naboth the Jezreelite happened to own a vineyard in Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. \n","So Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard to use as a vegetable garden, since it is next to my palace.

But now may my life be precious in your sight.” \n   \n","Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him.” \n  So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king. \n   \n","And Elijah said to King Ahaziah, “This is what the LORD says: Is there really no God in Israel for you to inquire of His word? Is that why you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.” \n   \n","So Ahaziah died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. And since he had no son, Jehoram  succeeded him in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat over Judah. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, along with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? \n"],["Shortly before the LORD took Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal, \n","and Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to Bethel.” \n  But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” \n  So they went down to Bethel. \n   \n","Then the sons of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said, “Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from you today?” \n  “Yes, I know,” he replied. “Do not speak of it.” \n   \n","And Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to Jericho.” \n  But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” \n  So they went to Jericho. \n   \n","Then the sons of the prophets at Jericho came up to Elisha and said, “Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from you today?” \n  “Yes, I know,” he replied. “Do not speak of it.” \n   \n","And Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to the Jordan.” \n  But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” \n  So the two of them went on. \n   \n","Then a company of fifty of the sons of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing Elijah and Elisha as the two of them stood by the Jordan. \n","And Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the waters, which parted to the right and to the left, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground. \n   \n","After they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken away from you?” \n  “Please, let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,” Elisha replied. \n   \n","“You have requested a difficult thing,” said Elijah. “Nevertheless, if you see me as I am taken from you, it will be yours. But if not, then it will not be so.” \n   \n","As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up into heaven in a whirlwind. \n   \n","As Elisha watched, he cried out, “My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!” And he saw Elijah no more. So taking hold of his own clothes, he tore them in two. \n   \n","Elisha also picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah, and he went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. \n","Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the waters. “Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?” he asked. \n  And when he had struck the waters, they parted to the right and to the left, and Elisha crossed over. \n   \n","When the sons of the prophets who were facing him from Jericho saw what had happened, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him. \n   \n","“Look now,” they said to Elisha, “we your servants have fifty valiant men. Please let them go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and put him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys.” \n  “Do not send them,” Elisha replied. \n   \n","But when they pressed him to the point of embarrassment, he said, “Send them.” \n  And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find Elijah. \n   \n","When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you not to go?” \n   \n","Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Please note, our lord, that the city’s location is good, as you can see. But the water is bad and the land is unfruitful.” \n   \n","“Bring me a new bowl,” he replied, “and put some salt in it.” \n  So they brought it to him, \n","and Elisha went out to the spring, cast the salt into it, and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘I have healed this water. No longer will it cause death or unfruitfulness. ’” \n   \n","And the waters there have been healthy to this day, according to the word spoken by Elisha. \n   \n","From there, Elisha went up to Bethel, and as he was walking up the road, a group of boys  came out of the city and jeered at him, chanting, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!” \n   \n","Then he turned around, looked at them, and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. \n  Suddenly two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys. \n   \n","And Elisha went on to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria. \n"],["In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah, Jehoram  son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria twelve years. \n","And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as his father and mother had done. He removed the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made. \n   \n","Nevertheless, he clung to the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them. \n   \n","Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he would render to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams. \n","But after the death of Ahab, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. \n","So at that time King Jehoram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel. \n","And he sent a message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?” \n  “I will go,” replied Jehoshaphat. “I am like you, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.” \n","Then he asked, “Which way shall we go up?” \n  “By way of the Desert of Edom,” replied Joram. \n   \n","So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out, and after they had traveled a roundabout route for seven days, they had no water for their army or for their animals. \n   \n","“Alas,” said the king of Israel, “for the LORD has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hand of Moab!” \n   \n","But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of the LORD here? Let us inquire of the LORD through him.” \n  And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah. ” \n   \n","Jehoshaphat affirmed, “The word of the LORD is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. \n   \n","Elisha, however, said to the king of Israel, “What have we to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and of your mother!” \n  “No,” replied the king of Israel, “for it is the LORD who has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hand of Moab.” \n   \n","Then Elisha said, “As surely as the LORD of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not for my regard for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or acknowledge you. \n","But now, bring me a harpist. ” \n  And while the harpist played, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha \n","and he said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Dig this valley full of ditches.’ \n","For the LORD says, ‘You will not see wind or rain, but the valley will be filled with water, and you will drink—you and your cattle and your animals.’ \n","This is a simple matter in the sight of the LORD, and He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. \n","And you shall attack every fortified city and every city of importance. You shall cut down every good tree, stop up every spring, and ruin every good field with stones.” \n   \n","The next morning, at the time of the morning sacrifice, water suddenly flowed from the direction of Edom and filled the land. \n   \n","Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. So all who could bear arms, young and old, were summoned and stationed at the border. \n","When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water, and it looked as red as blood to the Moabites across the way. \n   \n","“This is blood!” they exclaimed. “The kings have clashed swords and slaughtered one another. Now to the plunder, Moab!” \n   \n","But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and attacked them, and they fled before them. So the Israelites invaded their land and struck down the Moabites. \n","They destroyed the cities, and each man threw stones on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up every spring and cut down every good tree. Only Kir-haraseth was left with stones in place, but men with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well. \n   \n","When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not prevail. \n","So he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him, and offered him as a burnt offering on the city wall. \n  And there was great fury against the Israelites, so they withdrew and returned to their own land. \n"],["Now the wife of one of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant, my husband, is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD. And now his creditor is coming to take my two children as his slaves!” \n   \n","“How can I help you?” asked Elisha. “Tell me, what do you have in the house?” \n  She answered, “Your servant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.” \n   \n","“Go,” said Elisha, “borrow jars, even empty ones, from all your neighbors. Do not gather just a few. \n","Then go inside, shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour oil into all these jars, setting the full ones aside.” \n   \n","So she left him, and after she had shut the door behind her and her sons, they kept bringing jars to her, and she kept pouring. \n","When all the jars were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another.” \n  But he replied, “There are no more jars.” Then the oil stopped flowing. \n   \n","She went and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt. Then you and your sons can live on the remainder.” \n   \n","One day Elisha went to Shunem, and a prominent woman who lived there persuaded him to have a meal. So whenever he would pass by, he would stop there to eat. \n   \n","Then the woman said to her husband, “Behold, now I know that the one who often comes our way is a holy man of God. \n","Please let us make a small room upstairs and put in it a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp for him. Then when he comes to us, he can stay there.” \n   \n","One day Elisha came to visit and went to his upper room to lie down. \n","And he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call the Shunammite woman.” \n  And when he had called her, she stood before him, \n","and Elisha said to Gehazi, “Now tell her, ‘Look, you have gone to all this trouble for us. What can we do for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?’” \n  “I have a home among my own people,” she replied. \n   \n","So he asked, “Then what should be done for her?” \n  “Well, she has no son,” Gehazi replied, “and her husband is old.” \n   \n","“Call her,” said Elisha. \n  So Gehazi called her, and she stood in the doorway. \n","And Elisha declared, “At this time next year, you will hold a son in your arms.” \n  “No, my lord,” she said. “Do not lie to your maidservant, O man of God.” \n   \n","But the woman did conceive, and at that time the next year she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her. \n   \n","And the child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the harvesters. \n   \n","“My head! My head!” he complained to his father. \n  So his father told a servant, “Carry him to his mother.” \n   \n","After the servant had picked him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died. \n","And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God. Then she shut the door and went out. \n   \n","And the woman called her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, that I may go quickly to the man of God and return.” \n   \n","“Why would you go to him today?” he replied. “It is not a New Moon or a Sabbath.” \n  “Everything is all right,” she said. \n   \n","Then she saddled the donkey and told her servant, “Drive onward; do not slow the pace for me unless I tell you.” \n","So she set out and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. \n  When the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, there is the Shunammite woman. \n","Please run out now to meet her and ask, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?’” \n  And she answered, “Everything is all right.” \n   \n","When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she clung to his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is in deep distress, and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me.” \n   \n","Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not deceive me?’” \n   \n","So Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tie up your garment, take my staff in your hand, and go! If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer him. Then lay my staff on the boy’s face.” \n   \n","And the mother of the boy said, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her. \n   \n","Gehazi went on ahead of them and laid the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or response. So he went back to meet Elisha and told him, “The boy has not awakened.” \n   \n","When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his bed. \n","So he went in, closed the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the LORD. \n   \n","Then Elisha got on the bed and lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eye to eye, and hand to hand. As he stretched himself out over him, the boy’s body became warm. \n","Elisha turned away and paced back and forth across the room. Then he got on the bed and stretched himself out over the boy again, and the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. \n   \n","Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite woman.” So he called her and she came. \n  Then Elisha said, “Pick up your son.” \n   \n","She came in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out. \n   \n","When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As the sons of the prophets were sitting at his feet, he said to his attendant, “Put on the large pot and boil some stew for the sons of the prophets.” \n   \n","One of them went out to the field to gather herbs, and he found a wild vine from which he gathered as many wild gourds as his garment could hold. Then he came back and cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were. \n   \n","And they poured it out for the men to eat, but when they tasted the stew they cried out, “There is death in the pot, O man of God!” And they could not eat it. \n   \n","Then Elisha said, “Get some flour.” He threw it into the pot and said, “Pour it out for the people to eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot. \n   \n","Now a man from Baal-shalishah came to the man of God with a sack of twenty loaves of barley bread from the first ripe grain. \n  “Give it to the people to eat,” said Elisha. \n   \n","But his servant asked, “How am I to set twenty loaves before a hundred men?” \n  “Give it to the people to eat,” said Elisha, “for this is what the LORD says: ‘They will eat and have some left over.’” \n   \n","So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD. \n"],["Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in his master’s sight and highly regarded, for through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. And he was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper. \n   \n","At this time the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken a young girl from the land of Israel, and she was serving Naaman’s wife. \n","She said to her mistress, “If only my master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would cure him of his leprosy.” \n   \n","And Naaman went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said. \n   \n","“Go now,” said the king of Aram, “and I will send you with a letter to the king of Israel.” \n  So Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver,  six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of clothing. \n   \n","And the letter that he took to the king of Israel stated: “With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman, so that you may cure him of his leprosy.” \n   \n","When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and asked, “Am I God, killing and giving life, that this man expects me to cure a leper? Surely you can see that he is seeking a quarrel with me!” \n   \n","Now when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king: “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let the man come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.” \n   \n","So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha’s house. \n   \n","Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.” \n   \n","But Naaman went away angry, saying, “I thought that he would surely come out, stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the spot to cure my leprosy. \n","Are not the Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not have washed in them and been cleansed?” So he turned and went away in a rage. \n   \n","Naaman’s servants, however, approached him and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, ‘Wash and be cleansed’?” \n   \n","So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored and became like that of a little child, and he was clean. \n   \n","Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God, stood before him, and declared, “Now I know for sure that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.” \n   \n","But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it.” And although Naaman urged him to accept it, he refused. \n   \n","“If you will not,” said Naaman, “please let me, your servant, be given as much soil as a pair of mules can carry. For your servant will never again make a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any other god but the LORD. \n","Yet may the LORD forgive your servant this one thing: When my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my arm, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant in this matter.” \n   \n","“Go in peace,” said Elisha. \n  But after Naaman had traveled a short distance, \n","Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Look, my master has spared this Aramean, Naaman, while not accepting what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.” \n   \n","So Gehazi pursued Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and asked, “Is everything all right?” \n   \n","“Everything is all right,” Gehazi replied. “My master has sent me to say, ‘I have just now discovered that two young men from the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver  and two sets of clothing.’” \n   \n","But Naaman insisted, “Please, take two talents.” And he urged Gehazi to accept them. Then he tied up two talents of silver in two bags along with two sets of clothing and gave them to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of Gehazi. \n   \n","When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the gifts from the servants and stored them in the house. Then he dismissed the men, and they departed. \n   \n","When Gehazi went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Gehazi, where have you been?” \n  “Your servant did not go anywhere,” he replied. \n   \n","But Elisha questioned him, “Did not my spirit go with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to accept money and clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants? \n","Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and your descendants forever!” \n  And as Gehazi left his presence, he was leprous—as white as snow. \n"],["Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Please take note that the place where we meet with you is too small for us. \n","Please let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a log so we can build ourselves a place to live there.” \n  “Go,” said Elisha. \n   \n","Then one of them said, “Please come with your servants.” \n  “I will come,” he replied. \n   \n","So Elisha went with them, and when they came to the Jordan, they began to cut down some trees. \n","As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axe head fell into the water. “Oh, my master,” he cried out, “it was borrowed!” \n   \n","“Where did it fall?” asked the man of God. \n  And when he showed him the place, the man of God cut a stick, threw it there, and made the iron float. \n   \n","“Lift it out,” he said, and the man reached out his hand and took it. \n   \n","Now the king of Aram was at war against Israel. After consulting with his servants, he said, “My camp will be in such and such a place.” \n   \n","Then the man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Be careful passing by this place, for the Arameans are going down there.” \n   \n","So the king of Israel sent word to the place the man of God had pointed out. Time and again  Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places. \n","For this reason the king of Aram became enraged and called his servants to demand of them, “Tell me, which one of us is on the side of the king of Israel?” \n   \n","But one of his servants replied, “No one, my lord the king. For Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.” \n   \n","So the king said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send men to capture him.” \n  On receiving the report, “Elisha is in Dothan,” \n","the king of Aram sent horses, chariots, and a great army. They went there by night and surrounded the city. \n   \n","When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early in the morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. So he asked Elisha, “Oh, my master, what are we to do?” \n   \n","“Do not be afraid,” Elisha answered, “for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” \n   \n","Then Elisha prayed, “O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see.” \n  And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw that the hills were full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. \n   \n","As the Arameans came down against him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, “Please strike these people with blindness.” So He struck them with blindness, according to the word of Elisha. \n   \n","And Elisha told them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will take you to the man you are seeking.” And he led them to Samaria. \n   \n","When they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O LORD, open the eyes of these men that they may see.” \n  Then the LORD opened their eyes, and they looked around and discovered that they were in Samaria. \n   \n","And when the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?” \n   \n","“Do not kill them,” he replied. “Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and then return to their master.” \n   \n","So the king prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. And the Aramean raiders did not come into the land of Israel again. \n   \n","Some time later, Ben-hadad king of Aram assembled his entire army and marched up to besiege Samaria. \n   \n","So there was a great famine in Samaria. Indeed, they besieged the city so long that a donkey’s head sold for eighty shekels of silver,  and a quarter cab of dove’s dung   sold for five shekels of silver. \n   \n","As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, “Help me, my lord the king!” \n   \n","He answered, “If the LORD does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or the winepress?” \n","Then the king asked her, “What is the matter?” \n  And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son, that we may eat him, and tomorrow we will eat my son.’ \n","So we boiled my son and ate him, and the next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son, that we may eat him.’ But she had hidden her son.” \n   \n","When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. And as he passed by on the wall, the people saw the sackcloth under his clothes next to his skin. \n","He announced, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders through this day!” \n   \n","Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “Do you see how this murderer has sent someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door to keep him out. Is not the sound of his master’s footsteps behind him?” \n   \n","While Elisha was still speaking with them, the messenger came down to him. And the king said, “This calamity is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?” \n"],["Then Elisha said, “Hear the word of the LORD! This is what the LORD says: ‘About this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria, a seah of fine flour   will sell for a shekel,  and two seahs of barley  will sell for a shekel.’” \n   \n","But the officer on whose arm the king leaned answered the man of God, “Look, even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could this really happen?” \n  “You will see it with your own eyes,” replied Elisha, “but you will not eat any of it.” \n   \n","Now there were four men with leprosy  at the entrance of the city gate, and they said to one another, “Why just sit here until we die? \n","If we say, ‘Let us go into the city,’ we will die there from the famine in the city; but if we sit here, we will also die. So come now, let us go over to the camp of the Arameans. If they let us live, we will live; if they kill us, we will die.” \n   \n","So they arose at twilight and went to the camp of the Arameans. But when they came to the outskirts of the camp, there was not a man to be found. \n","For the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a great army, so that they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel must have hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us.” \n   \n","Thus the Arameans had arisen and fled at twilight, abandoning their tents and horses and donkeys. The camp was intact, and they had run for their lives. \n   \n","When the lepers reached the edge of the camp, they went into a tent to eat and drink. Then they carried off the silver, gold, and clothing, and went and hid them. On returning, they entered another tent, carried off some items from there, and hid them. \n   \n","Finally, they said to one another, “We are not doing what is right. Today is a day of good news. If we are silent and wait until morning light, our sin will overtake us. Now, therefore, let us go and tell the king’s household.” \n   \n","So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city, saying, “We went to the Aramean camp and no one was there—not a trace—only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents were intact.” \n   \n","The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported to the king’s household. \n   \n","So the king got up in the night and said to his servants, “Let me tell you what the Arameans have done to us.

It was found to weigh a talent of gold  and was set with precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head. And David took a great amount of plunder from the city. \n   \n","David brought out the people who were there and put them to work  with saws, iron picks, and axes. And he did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem. \n   \n","Some time later, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai,  a descendant of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued. \n   \n","Once again there was a battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother  of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. \n   \n","And there was still another battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha, \n","and when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of David’s brother Shimei killed him. \n   \n","So these descendants of Rapha in Gath fell at the hands of David and his servants. \n"],["Then Satan  rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel. \n","So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan and bring me a report, so that I may know their number.” \n   \n","But Joab replied, “May the LORD multiply His troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all servants of my lord? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?” \n   \n","Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and traveled throughout Israel, and then he returned to Jerusalem. \n","And Joab reported to David the total number of the troops. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, including 470,000 in Judah. \n","But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count, because the king’s command was detestable to him. \n   \n","This command was also evil in the sight of God; so He struck Israel. \n   \n","Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.” \n   \n","And the LORD instructed Gad, David’s seer, \n","“Go and tell David that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am offering you three options. Choose one of them, and I will carry it out against you.’” \n   \n","So Gad went and said to David, “This is what the LORD says: ‘You must choose \n","between three years of famine, three months of being swept away  before your enemies and overtaken by their swords, or three days of the sword of the LORD—days of plague upon the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.’ Now then, decide how I should reply to Him who sent me.” \n   \n","David answered Gad, “I am deeply distressed. Please, let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.” \n   \n","So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead. \n   \n","Then God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and relented from the calamity, and He said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand now!” \n  At that time the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan  the Jebusite. \n   \n","When David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown. \n","And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave the order to count the people? I  am the one who has sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, please let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house, but do not let this plague remain upon Your people.” \n   \n","Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. \n","So David went up at the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD. \n   \n","Now Ornan was threshing wheat when he turned and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. \n","David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked out and saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed facedown before David. \n   \n","Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the site of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to the LORD. Sell it to me for the full price, so that the plague upon the people may be halted.” \n   \n","Ornan said to David, “My lord the king may take whatever seems good. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering—I will give it all.” \n   \n","“No,” replied King David, “I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for the LORD what belongs to you, nor will I offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” \n   \n","So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold  for the site. \n","And there he built an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called upon the LORD, who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering. \n   \n","Then the LORD spoke to the angel, who put his sword back into its sheath. \n   \n","At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there. \n","For the tabernacle of the LORD that Moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were presently at the high place in Gibeon, \n","but David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD. \n"],["Then David said, “Here shall be the house of the LORD God, as well as the altar of burnt offering for Israel.” \n   \n","So David gave orders to gather the foreigners in the land of Israel, from whom he appointed stonecutters to prepare finished stones for building the house of God. \n   \n","David provided a large quantity of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, together with more bronze than could be weighed \n","and more cedar logs than could be counted; for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large quantity of cedar logs to David. \n   \n","And David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent—famous and glorious throughout all lands. Therefore I must make preparations for it.” So David made lavish preparations before his death. \n   \n","Then David called for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel. \n   \n","“My son,” said David to Solomon, “it was in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God, \n","but this word of the LORD came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and waged great wars. You are not to build a house for My Name because you have shed so much blood on the ground before Me. \n","But a son will be born to you who will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name will be Solomon, and I will grant to Israel peace and quiet during his reign. \n","He is the one who will build a house for My Name. He will be My son, and I will be his Father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ \n   \n","Now, my son, may the LORD be with you, and may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as He said you would. \n","Above all, may the LORD give you insight and understanding when He puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the Law of the LORD your God. \n","Then you will succeed, if you carefully follow the statutes and ordinances that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged. \n   \n","Now behold, I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the LORD—100,000 talents of gold,  1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron too great to be weighed. I have also provided timber and stone, and you may add to them. \n   \n","You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and men skilled in every kind of work—\n","in gold and silver, bronze and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you.” \n   \n","Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon: \n","“Is not the LORD your God with you, and has He not granted you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before the LORD and His people. \n","Now set your heart and soul to seek the LORD your God. Get started building the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the LORD.” \n"],["When David was old and full of years, he installed his son Solomon as king over Israel. \n","Then he gathered all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites. \n   \n","The Levites thirty years of age or older were counted, and the total number of men was 38,000. \n","“Of these,” said David, “24,000 are to oversee the work of the house of the LORD, 6,000 are to be officers and judges, \n","4,000 are to be gatekeepers, and 4,000 are to praise the LORD with the instruments I have made for giving praise.” \n   \n","Then David divided the Levites into divisions according to the sons of Levi: \n  Gershom, Kohath, and Merari. \n   \n","The Gershonites: Ladan  and Shimei. \n   \n","The sons of Ladan: Jehiel  the first, Zetham, and Joel—three in all. \n   \n","The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran—three in all.

Aaron and his descendants were set apart forever to consecrate the most holy things, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister before Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name forever. \n","As for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi. \n   \n","The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. \n   \n","The descendants of Gershom: Shebuel was the first. \n   \n","The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah was the first.

If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever. \n","Consider now that the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong and do it.” \n   \n","Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple,  its buildings, storehouses, upper rooms, inner rooms, and the room for the mercy seat. \n","The plans contained everything David had in mind  for the courts of the house of the LORD, for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of God and of the dedicated things, \n","for the divisions of the priests and Levites, for all the work of service in the house of the LORD, and for all the articles of service in the house of the LORD: \n   \n","the weight of all the gold articles for every kind of service; \n  the weight of all the silver articles for every kind of service; \n   \n","the weight of the gold lampstands and their lamps, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps; \n  the weight of each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand; \n   \n","the weight of gold for each table of showbread, and of silver for the silver tables; \n   \n","the weight of the pure gold for the forks, sprinkling bowls, and pitchers; \n  the weight of each gold dish; \n  the weight of each silver bowl; \n   \n","the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense; \n  and the plans for the chariot of the gold cherubim that spread their wings and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the LORD. \n   \n","“All this,” said David, “all the details of this plan, the LORD has made clear to me in writing by His hand upon me.” \n   \n","David also said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do it.

In Your hands are power and might to exalt and give strength to all. \n   \n","Now therefore, our God, we give You thanks, and we praise Your glorious name. \n","But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from You, and from Your own hand we have given to You. \n","For we are foreigners and strangers in Your presence, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope. \n   \n","O LORD our God, from Your hand comes all this abundance that we have provided to build You a house for Your holy Name, and all of it belongs to You. \n","I know, my God, that You test the heart and delight in uprightness. All these things I have given willingly and with an upright heart, and now I have seen Your people who are present here giving joyfully and willingly to You. \n   \n","O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep this desire forever in the intentions of the hearts of Your people, and direct their hearts toward You. \n","And give my son Solomon a whole heart to keep and carry out all Your commandments, decrees, and statutes, and to build Your palace for which I have made provision.” \n   \n","Then David said to the whole assembly, “Blessed be the LORD your God.” \n  So the whole assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers.

And I will also give you riches and wealth and honor unlike anything given to the kings before you or after you.” \n   \n","So Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place in Gibeon before the Tent of Meeting, and he reigned over Israel. \n   \n","Solomon accumulated   1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. \n","The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills. \n   \n","Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue; the royal merchants purchased them from Kue. \n","A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver,  and a horse for a hundred and fifty.

This is ordained for Israel forever. \n   \n","The house that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods. \n","But who is able to build a house for Him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain Him?

He overlaid the inside with pure gold. \n   \n","He paneled the main room with cypress, which he overlaid with fine gold and decorated with palm trees and chains. \n","He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty, and its gold was from Parvaim. \n","He overlaid its beams, thresholds, walls, and doors with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls. \n   \n","Then he made the Most Holy Place;  its length corresponded to the width of the temple—twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. And he overlaid the inside with six hundred talents of fine gold. \n","The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper area with gold. \n   \n","In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim of sculptured work, and he overlaid them with gold. \n","The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long  and touched the wall of the temple, and its other wing was five cubits long and touched the wing of the other cherub. \n","The wing of the second cherub also measured five cubits and touched the wall of the temple, while its other wing measured five cubits and touched the wing of the first cherub. \n","So the total wingspan of these cherubim was twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main room. \n   \n","He made the veil of blue, purple, and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim woven into it. \n   \n","In front of the temple he made two pillars, which together were thirty-five cubits high, each with a capital on top measuring five cubits. \n   \n","He made interwoven chains  and put them on top of the pillars. He made a hundred pomegranates and fastened them into the chainwork. \n","Then he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south and one on the north. The pillar on the south he named Jachin,  and the pillar on the north he named Boaz. \n"],["He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high. \n   \n","He also made the Sea of cast metal. It was circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim, five cubits in height, and thirty cubits in circumference. \n","Below the rim, figures of oxen encircled it, ten per cubit all the way around the Sea, cast in two rows as a part of the Sea. \n   \n","The Sea stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The Sea rested on them, with all their hindquarters toward the center. \n","It was a handbreadth thick,  and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold three thousand baths. \n   \n","He also made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. The parts of the burnt offering were rinsed in them, but the priests used the Sea for washing. \n   \n","He made ten gold lampstands according to their specifications and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. \n   \n","Additionally, he made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold bowls. \n   \n","He made the courtyard of the priests and the large court with its doors, and he overlaid the doors with bronze. \n   \n","He put the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner. \n   \n","Additionally, Huram made the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls. \n  So Huram finished the work that he had undertaken for King Solomon in the house of God: \n   \n","the two pillars; \n  the two bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars; \n  the two sets of network covering both bowls of the capitals atop the pillars; \n   \n","the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network covering both the bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars); \n   \n","the stands; \n  the basins on the stands; \n   \n","the Sea; \n  the twelve oxen underneath the Sea; \n   \n","and the pots, shovels, meat forks, and all the other articles. \n  All these objects that Huram-abi made for King Solomon for the house of the LORD were of polished bronze. \n","The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zeredah. \n","Solomon made all these articles in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze could not be determined. \n   \n","Solomon also made all the furnishings for the house of God: \n  the golden altar; \n  the tables on which was placed the Bread of the Presence; \n   \n","the lampstands of pure gold and their lamps, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed; \n   \n","the flowers, lamps, and tongs of gold—of purest gold; \n   \n","the wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, ladles, and censers of purest gold; \n  and the gold doors of the temple: the inner doors to the Most Holy Place  as well as the doors of the main hall. \n"],["So all the work that Solomon had performed for the house of the LORD was completed. \n  Then Solomon brought in the items his father David had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and all the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of the house of God. \n   \n","At that time Solomon assembled in Jerusalem the elders of Israel—all the tribal heads and family leaders of the Israelites—to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Zion, the City of David. \n","So all the men of Israel came together to the king at the feast in the seventh month. \n   \n","When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark, \n","and they brought up the ark and the Tent of Meeting with all its sacred furnishings. The Levitical priests carried them up. \n   \n","There, before the ark, King Solomon and the whole congregation of Israel who had assembled with him sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered. \n   \n","Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim. \n","For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its poles. \n   \n","The poles of the ark extended far enough that their ends were visible from in front of the inner sanctuary,  but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are there to this day. \n   \n","There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites after they had come out of Egypt. \n   \n","Now all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves regardless of their divisions. And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, \n","all the Levitical singers—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives—stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps, and lyres, accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets. \n","The trumpeters and singers joined together to praise and thank the LORD with one voice.

So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. \n   \n","The priests stood at their posts, as did the Levites with the musical instruments of the LORD, which King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD and with which David had offered praise, saying, “For His loving devotion endures forever.” Across from the Levites, the priests sounded trumpets, and all the Israelites were standing. \n   \n","Then Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard in front of the house of the LORD, and there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, since the bronze altar he had made could not contain all these offerings. \n   \n","So at that time Solomon and all Israel with him—a very great assembly of people from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt—kept the feast  for seven days. \n","On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for the dedication of the altar had lasted seven days, and the feast seven days more. \n   \n","On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the good things that the LORD had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people Israel. \n   \n","When Solomon had finished the house of the LORD and the royal palace, successfully carrying out all that was in his heart to do for the house of the LORD and for his own palace, \n","the LORD appeared to him at night and said to him: \n  “I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice. \n","If I close the sky so there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send a plague among My people, \n","and if My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land. \n   \n","Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place. \n","For I have now chosen and consecrated this temple so that My Name may be there forever. My eyes and My heart will be there for all time. \n   \n","And as for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, doing all I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and ordinances, \n","then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with your father David when I said, ‘You will never fail to have a man to rule over Israel.’ \n   \n","But if you turn away and forsake the statutes and commandments I have set before you, and if you go off to serve and worship other gods, \n","then I will uproot Israel from the soil I have given them, and I will banish from My presence this temple I have sanctified for My Name. I will make it an object of scorn and ridicule among all the peoples. \n   \n","And when this temple has become a heap of rubble, all who pass by it will be appalled and say, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’ \n","And others will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—because of this, He has brought all this disaster upon them.’” \n"],["Now at the end of the twenty years during which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own palace, \n","Solomon rebuilt the cities Hiram  had given him and settled Israelites there. \n   \n","Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it. \n","He built Tadmor in the wilderness, in addition to all the store cities that he had built in Hamath. \n","He rebuilt Upper and Lower Beth-horon as fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars, \n","as well as Baalath, all the store cities that belonged to Solomon, and all the cities for his chariots and horses  —whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion. \n   \n","As for all the people who remained of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (the people who were not Israelites)—\n","their descendants who remained in the land, those whom the Israelites were unable to destroy—Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this day. \n   \n","But Solomon did not consign any of the Israelites to slave labor, because they were his men of war, his officers and captains, and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry. \n","They were also the chief officers for King Solomon: 250 supervisors. \n   \n","Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her. For he said, “My wife must not live in the house of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy.” \n   \n","At that time Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD he had built in front of the portico. \n","He observed the daily requirement for offerings according to the commandment of Moses for Sabbaths, New Moons, and the three annual appointed feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread,  the Feast of Weeks,  and the Feast of Tabernacles. \n   \n","In keeping with the ordinances of his father David, Solomon appointed the divisions of the priests over their service, and the Levites for their duties to offer praise and to minister before the priests according to the daily requirement. He also appointed gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate, for this had been the command of David, the man of God. \n","They did not turn aside from the king’s command regarding the priests or the Levites or any matter concerning the treasuries. \n   \n","Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out, from the day the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed. \n   \n","Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth   on the coast of Edom. \n","So Hiram sent him ships captained by his servants, along with crews of experienced sailors. They went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir and acquired from there 450 talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon. \n"],["Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon, she came to test him with difficult questions. She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan—with camels bearing spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. \n  So she came to Solomon and spoke with him about all that was on her mind. \n","And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for him to explain. \n   \n","When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built, \n","the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he presented  at the house of the LORD, it took her breath away. \n   \n","She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words  and wisdom is true. \n","But I did not believe the reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not half of the greatness of your wisdom was told to me. You have far exceeded the report I heard. \n","How blessed are your men! How blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom! \n","Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you to set you on His throne to be king for the LORD your God. Because your God loved Israel enough to establish them forever, He has made you king over them to carry out justice and righteousness.” \n   \n","Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. \n   \n","(The servants of Hiram and of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought algum  wood and precious stones. \n","The king made the algum wood into steps  for the house of the LORD and for the king’s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers. Never before had anything like them been seen in the land of Judah.) \n   \n","King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired—whatever she asked—far more than she had brought the king. Then she left and returned to her own country, along with her servants. \n   \n","The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was 666 talents, \n","not including the revenue from the merchants and traders. And all the Arabian kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon. \n   \n","King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold  went into each shield. \n","He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold  went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. \n   \n","Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. \n","The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest. \n","Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom. \n   \n","All King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon. \n","For the king had the ships of Tarshish   that went with Hiram’s   servants, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. \n   \n","So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. \n","All the kings of the earth sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart. \n","Year after year, each visitor would bring his tribute: articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. \n   \n","Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. \n","He reigned over all the kings from the Euphrates  to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. \n","The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills. \n","Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from all the lands. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Solomon, from beginning to end, are they not written in the Records of Nathan the Prophet, in the Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the Visions of Iddo the Seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat? \n","Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. \n","And Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. And his son Rehoboam reigned in his place. \n"],["Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king. \n","When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about this, he returned from Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon. \n","So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel came to Rehoboam and said, \n","“Your father put a heavy yoke on us. But now you should lighten the burden of your father’s service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.” \n   \n","Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people departed. \n   \n","Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How do you advise me to respond to these people?” he asked. \n   \n","They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and please them by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.” \n   \n","But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders; instead, he consulted the young men who had grown up with him and served him. \n","He asked them, “What message do you advise that we send back to these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?” \n   \n","The young men who had grown up with him replied, “This is how you should answer these people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it lighter.’ This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist! \n","Whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.’” \n   \n","After three days, Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, since the king had said, “Come back to me on the third day.” \n","And the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders \n","and spoke to them as the young men had advised, saying, “Whereas my father made your yoke heavy, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.” \n   \n","So the king did not listen to the people, and indeed this turn of events was from God, in order that the LORD might fulfill the word that He had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat. \n   \n","When all Israel saw that the king had refused to listen to them, they answered  the king: \n  “What portion do we have in David, \n and what inheritance in the son of Jesse? \n To your tents, O Israel! \n Look now to your own house, O David!” \n  So all the Israelites went home, \n","but Rehoboam still reigned over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah. \n   \n","Then King Rehoboam sent out Hadoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste and escaped to Jerusalem. \n","So to this day Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David. \n"],["When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mobilized the house of Judah and Benjamin—180,000 chosen warriors—to fight against Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam. \n","But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God: \n","“Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin \n","that this is what the LORD says: ‘You are not to go up and fight against your brothers. Each of you must return home, for this word is from Me.’” \n  So they listened to the words of the LORD and turned back from going against Jeroboam. \n   \n","Rehoboam continued to live in Jerusalem, and he built up cities for defense in Judah. \n","He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, \n","Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, \n","Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, \n","Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, \n","Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, the fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin. \n","He strengthened their fortresses and put officers in them, with supplies of food, oil, and wine. \n","He also put shields and spears in all the cities and strengthened them greatly. So Judah and Benjamin belonged to him. \n   \n","Moreover, the priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel stood with Rehoboam. \n","For the Levites left their pasturelands and their possessions and went to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the LORD. \n","And Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat demons and calf idols he had made. \n   \n","Those from every tribe of Israel who had set their hearts to seek the LORD their God followed the Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers. \n","So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years, because they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon. \n   \n","And Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab. \n","She bore sons to him: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. \n   \n","After her, he married Maacah daughter of Absalom, and she bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. \n","Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. \n   \n","Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, intending to make him king. \n","Rehoboam also acted wisely by dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and sought many wives for them. \n"],["After Rehoboam had established his sovereignty and royal power, he and all Israel  with him forsook the Law of the LORD. \n","In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem \n","with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen,  and countless troops who came with him out of Egypt—Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites. \n","He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. \n   \n","Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he said to them, “This is what the LORD says: ‘You have forsaken Me; therefore, I have forsaken you into the hand of Shishak.’” \n   \n","So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The LORD is righteous.” \n   \n","When the LORD saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them, but will soon grant them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak. \n","Nevertheless, they will become his servants, so that they may learn the difference between serving Me and serving the kings of other lands.” \n   \n","So King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and seized the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields that Solomon had made. \n   \n","Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and committed them to the care of the captains of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. \n","And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards would go with him, bearing the shields, and later they would return them to the guardroom. \n   \n","Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the anger of the LORD turned away from him, and He did not destroy him completely. Indeed, conditions were good in Judah. \n   \n","Thus King Rehoboam established himself in Jerusalem. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel in which to put His Name. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. \n","And Rehoboam did evil because he did not set his heart to seek the LORD. \n   \n","Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the Prophet and of Iddo the Seer concerning the genealogies? There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their days. \n","And Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And his son Abijah  reigned in his place. \n"],["In the eighteenth year of Jeroboam’s reign, Abijah  became king of Judah, \n","and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Micaiah   daughter  of Uriel; she was from Gibeah. \n  And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. \n","Abijah went into battle with an army of 400,000 chosen men, while Jeroboam drew up in formation against him with 800,000 chosen and mighty men of valor. \n   \n","Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the hill country of Ephraim and said, “Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel! \n","Do you not know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt  ? \n","Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master. \n","Then worthless and wicked men gathered around him to resist Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young, inexperienced, and unable to resist them. \n   \n","And now you think you can resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David’s descendants. You are indeed a vast army, and you have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods. \n","But did you not drive out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites? And did you not make priests for yourselves as do the peoples of other lands? Now whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams can become a priest of things that are not gods. \n   \n","But as for us, the LORD is our God. We have not forsaken Him; the priests who minister to the LORD are sons of Aaron, and the Levites attend to their duties. \n","Every morning and every evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD. They set out the rows of showbread on the ceremonially clean table, and every evening they light the lamps of the gold lampstand. We are carrying out the requirements of the LORD our God, while you have forsaken Him. \n   \n","Now behold, God Himself is with us as our head, and His priests with their trumpets sound the battle call against you. O children of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you will not succeed.” \n   \n","Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to ambush from the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah, the ambush was behind them. \n","When Judah turned and discovered that the battle was both before and behind them, they cried out to the LORD. Then the priests blew the trumpets, \n","and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. And when they raised the cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. \n   \n","So the Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands. \n","Then Abijah and his people struck them with a mighty blow, and 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain. \n","Thus the Israelites were subdued at that time, and the men of Judah prevailed because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers. \n   \n","Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured some cities from him: Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, along with their villages. \n   \n","Jeroboam did not again recover his power during the days of Abijah, and the LORD struck him down and he died. \n   \n","But Abijah grew strong, married fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. \n","Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, along with his ways and his words, are written in the Treatise  of the Prophet Iddo. \n"],["Then Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And his son Asa reigned in his place, and in his days the land was at peace for ten years. \n   \n","And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God. \n","He removed the foreign altars and high places, shattered the sacred pillars, and chopped down the Asherah poles. \n","He commanded the people of Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandments. \n","He also removed the high places and incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and under him the kingdom was at peace. \n   \n","Because the land was at peace, Asa built fortified cities in Judah. In those days no one made war with him, because the LORD had given him rest. \n","So he said to the people of Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, with doors and bars. The land is still ours because we have sought the LORD our God. We have sought Him and He has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered. \n   \n","Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah bearing large shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin bearing small shields and drawing the bow. All these were mighty men of valor. \n   \n","Then Zerah the Cushite came against them with an army of 1,000,000 men  and 300 chariots, and they advanced as far as Mareshah. \n","So Asa marched out against him and lined up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah. \n   \n","Then Asa cried out to the LORD his God: “O LORD, there is no one besides You to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on You, and in Your name we have come against this multitude. O LORD, You are our God. Do not let a mere mortal prevail against You.” \n   \n","So the LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah, and the Cushites fled. \n","Then Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. The Cushites fell and could not recover, for they were crushed before the LORD and His army. So the people of Judah carried off a great amount of plunder \n","and attacked all the cities around Gerar, because the terror of the LORD had fallen upon them. They plundered all the cities, since there was much plunder there. \n","They also attacked the tents of the herdsmen and carried off many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem. \n"],["Now the Spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded. \n","So he went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is with you when you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you, but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you. \n","For many years Israel has been without the true God, without a priest to instruct them, and without the law. \n","But in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought Him, and He was found by them. \n","In those days there was no safety for travelers, because the residents of the lands had many conflicts. \n","Nation was crushed by nation, and city by city, for God afflicted them with all kinds of adversity. \n","But as for you, be strong; do not be discouraged, for your work will be rewarded.” \n   \n","When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded  the prophet, he took courage and removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He then restored the altar of the LORD that was in front of the portico of the LORD’s temple. \n","And he assembled all Judah and Benjamin, along with those from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who had settled among them, for great numbers had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. \n   \n","So they gathered together in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign. \n","At that time they sacrificed to the LORD seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep from all the plunder they had brought back. \n","Then they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul. \n","And whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, would be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman. \n","They took an oath to the LORD with a loud voice, with shouting, trumpets, and rams’ horns. \n","And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn it with all their heart. They had sought Him earnestly, and He was found by them. So the LORD gave them rest on every side. \n   \n","King Asa also removed his grandmother  Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made a detestable Asherah pole. Asa chopped down the pole, crushed it, and burned it in the Kidron Valley. \n","The high places were not removed from Israel, but Asa’s heart was fully devoted all his days. \n","And he brought into the house of God the silver and gold articles that he and his father had dedicated. \n   \n","And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign. \n"],["In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah. \n","So Asa withdrew the silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the royal palace, and he sent it with this message to Ben-hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus: \n","“Let there be a treaty  between me and you, between my father and your father. See, I have sent you silver and gold. Now go and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.” \n   \n","And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. \n   \n","When Baasha learned of this, he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned his work. \n","Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had used for building. And with these materials he built up Geba and Mizpah. \n   \n","At that time Hanani the seer came to King Asa of Judah and told him, “Because you have relied on the king of Aram and not on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand. \n","Were not the Cushites  and Libyans a vast army with many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD, He delivered them into your hand. \n","For the eyes of the LORD roam to and fro over all the earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are fully devoted to Him. You have acted foolishly in this matter. From now on, therefore, you will be at war.” \n   \n","Asa was angry with the seer and became so enraged over this matter that he put the man in prison. And at the same time Asa oppressed some of the people. \n   \n","Now the rest of the acts of Asa, from beginning to end, are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. \n","In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his malady became increasingly severe. Yet even in his illness he did not seek the LORD, but only the physicians. \n   \n","So in the forty-first year of his reign, Asa died and rested with his fathers. \n","And he was buried in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier that was full of spices and various blended perfumes; then they made a great fire in his honor. \n"],["Asa’s son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place, and he strengthened himself against Israel. \n","He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured. \n   \n","Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier ways  of his father David. He did not seek out the Baals, \n","but he sought the God of his father and walked by His commandments rather than the practices of Israel. \n","So the LORD established the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought him tribute, so that he had an abundance of riches and honor. \n","And his heart took delight  in the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah. \n   \n","In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah, \n","accompanied by certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah—along with the priests Elishama and Jehoram. \n","They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD. They went throughout the towns of Judah and taught the people. \n   \n","And the dread of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat. \n","Some Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats from their flocks. \n   \n","Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah \n","and kept vast supplies in the cities of Judah. He also had warriors in Jerusalem who were mighty men of valor. \n","These are their numbers according to the houses of their fathers: \n  From Judah, the commanders of thousands: \n  Adnah the commander, and with him 300,000 mighty men of valor; \n   \n","next to him, Jehohanan the commander, and with him 280,000; \n   \n","and next to him, Amasiah son of Zichri, the volunteer for the LORD, and with him 200,000 mighty men of valor. \n   \n","From Benjamin: \n  Eliada, a mighty man of valor, and with him 200,000 armed with bows and shields; \n   \n","and next to him, Jehozabad, and with him 180,000 armed for battle. \n   \n","These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah. \n"],["Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage. \n","And some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria, where Ahab sacrificed many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him, and urged him to march up to Ramoth-gilead. \n   \n","Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?” \n  And Jehoshaphat replied, “I am like you, and my people are your people; we will join you in the war.” \n   \n","But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.” \n   \n","So the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men, and asked them, “Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?” \n  “Go up,” they replied, “and God will deliver it into the hand of the king.” \n   \n","But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here of whom we can inquire?” \n   \n","The king of Israel answered, “There is still one man who can ask the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, but only bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” \n  “The king should not say that!” Jehoshaphat replied. \n   \n","So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.” \n   \n","Dressed in royal attire, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. \n   \n","Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for himself iron horns and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are finished off.’” \n   \n","And all the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.” \n   \n","Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah instructed him, “Behold, with one accord the words of the prophets are favorable to the king. So please let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably.” \n   \n","But Micaiah said, “As surely as the LORD lives, I will speak whatever my God tells me.” \n   \n","When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?” \n  “Go up and triumph,” Micaiah replied, “for they will be given into your hand.” \n   \n","But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the LORD?” \n   \n","So Micaiah declared: \n  “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills \n like sheep without a shepherd. \n And the LORD said, ‘These people have no master; \n let each one return home in peace.’” \n   \n","Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for me, but only bad?” \n   \n","Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left. \n   \n","And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ \n  And one suggested this, and another that. \n   \n","Then a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ \n  ‘By what means?’ asked the LORD. \n   \n","And he replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ \n  ‘You will surely entice him and prevail,’ said the LORD. ‘Go and do it.’ \n   \n","So you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours, and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you.” \n   \n","Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up, struck Micaiah in the face, and demanded, “Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go when He departed from me to speak with you?” \n   \n","Micaiah replied, “You will soon see, on that day when you go and hide in an inner room.” \n   \n","And the king of Israel declared, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son, \n","and tell them that this is what the king says: ‘Put this man in prison and feed him only bread and water until I return safely.’” \n   \n","But Micaiah replied, “If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Take heed, all you people!” \n   \n","So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. \n","And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. \n   \n","Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.” \n   \n","When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “This is the king of Israel!” So they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him. \n","And when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. \n   \n","However, a certain man drew his bow without taking special aim, and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So the king said to his charioteer, “Turn around  and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!” \n   \n","The battle raged throughout that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. And at sunset he died. \n"],["When Jehoshaphat king of Judah had returned safely to his home in Jerusalem, \n","Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to confront him and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this, the wrath of the LORD is upon you. \n","However, some good is found in you, for you have removed the Asherah poles from the land and have set your heart on seeking God.” \n   \n","Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and once again he went out among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers. \n","He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah. \n","Then he said to the judges, “Consider carefully what you do, for you are not judging for man, but for the LORD, who is with you when you render judgment. \n","And now, may the fear of the LORD be upon you. Be careful what you do, for with the LORD our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery.” \n   \n","Moreover, Jehoshaphat appointed in Jerusalem some of the Levites, priests, and heads of the Israelite families to judge on behalf of the LORD and to settle disputes. And they lived in Jerusalem. \n","He commanded them, saying, “You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD. \n","For every dispute that comes before you from your brothers who dwell in their cities—whether it regards bloodshed or some other violation of law, commandments, statutes, or ordinances—you are to warn them, so that they will not incur guilt before the LORD and wrath will not come upon you and your brothers. Do this, and you will not incur guilt. \n   \n","Note that Amariah, the chief priest, will be over you in all that pertains to the LORD, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all that pertains to the king. And the Levites will serve as officers before you. Act resolutely; may the LORD be with the upright!” \n"],["After this, the Moabites and Ammonites, together with some of the Meunites, came to make war against Jehoshaphat. \n","Then some men came and told Jehoshaphat, “A vast army is coming against you from Edom,  from beyond the Sea; they are already in Hazazon-tamar” (that is, En-gedi). \n   \n","Jehoshaphat was alarmed and set his face to seek the LORD. And he proclaimed a fast throughout Judah. \n","So the people of Judah gathered to seek the LORD, and indeed, they came from all the cities of Judah to seek Him. \n   \n","Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the LORD in front of the new courtyard \n","and said, “O LORD, God of our fathers, are You not the God who is in heaven, and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in Your hand, and no one can stand against You. \n   \n","Our God, did You not drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham Your friend? \n","They have lived in the land and have built in it a sanctuary for Your Name, saying, \n","‘If disaster comes upon us—whether sword or judgment, plague or famine—we will stand before this temple and before You, for Your Name is in this temple. We will cry out to You in our distress, and You will hear us and save us.’ \n   \n","And now, here are the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, whom You did not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt; but Israel turned away from them and did not destroy them. \n","See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession that You gave us as an inheritance. \n   \n","Our God, will You not judge them? For we are powerless before this vast army that comes against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.” \n   \n","Meanwhile all the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, were standing before the LORD. \n   \n","Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite from Asaph’s descendants, as he stood in the midst of the assembly. \n","And he said, “Listen, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Listen, King Jehoshaphat! This is what the LORD says: ‘Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army, for the battle does not belong to you, but to God. \n","Tomorrow you are to march down against them. You will see them coming up the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley facing the Wilderness of Jeruel. \n","You need not fight this battle. Take up your positions, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid or discouraged. Go out and face them tomorrow, for the LORD is with you.’” \n   \n","Then Jehoshaphat bowed facedown, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down before the LORD to worship Him. \n","And the Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up to praise the LORD, the God of Israel, shouting in a very loud voice. \n   \n","Early in the morning they got up and left for the Wilderness of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood up and said, “Hear me, O people of Judah and Jerusalem. Believe in the LORD your God, and you will be upheld; believe in His prophets, and you will succeed.” \n   \n","Then Jehoshaphat consulted with the people and appointed those who would sing to the LORD and praise the splendor of His holiness. As they went out before the army, they were singing: \n  “Give thanks to the LORD, \n for His loving devotion endures forever.” \n   \n","The moment they began their shouts and praises, the LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir who had come against Judah, and they were defeated. \n","The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, devoting them to destruction. And when they had made an end to the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another. \n   \n","When the men of Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked for the vast army, but there were only corpses lying on the ground; no one had escaped. \n","Then Jehoshaphat and his people went to carry off the plunder, and they found on the bodies an abundance of goods and valuables  —more than they could carry away. They were gathering the plunder for three days because there was so much. \n   \n","On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, where they blessed the LORD. Therefore that place is called the Valley of Beracah to this day. \n   \n","Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at their head, returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies. \n","So they entered Jerusalem and went into the house of the LORD with harps, lyres, and trumpets. \n   \n","And the fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel. \n","Then Jehoshaphat’s kingdom was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side. \n   \n","So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. \n   \n","And Jehoshaphat walked in the way of his father Asa and did not turn away from it; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD. \n   \n","The high places, however, were not removed; the people had not yet set their hearts on the God of their fathers. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from beginning to end, they are indeed written in the Chronicles of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel. \n   \n","Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted wickedly. \n","They agreed to make ships to go to Tarshish, and these were built in Ezion-geber. \n   \n","Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed your works.” \n  So the ships were wrecked and were unable to sail to Tarshish. \n"],["And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And his son Jehoram reigned in his place. \n   \n","Jehoram’s brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; these were all sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. \n","Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and precious things, as well as the fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn. \n   \n","When Jehoram had established himself over his father’s kingdom, he strengthened himself by putting to the sword all his brothers along with some of the princes of Israel. \n","Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. \n   \n","And Jehoram walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done. For he married a daughter of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD. \n","Yet the LORD was unwilling to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant He had made with David, and since He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever. \n   \n","In the days of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against the hand of Judah and appointed their own king. \n","So Jehoram crossed into Edom with his officers and all his chariots. When the Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, he rose up and attacked  by night. \n   \n","So to this day Edom has been in rebellion against the hand of Judah. Likewise, Libnah rebelled against his rule at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers. \n   \n","Jehoram had also built high places on the hills of Judah; he had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray. \n   \n","Then a letter came to Jehoram from Elijah the prophet, which stated: \n  “This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: \n  ‘You have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah, \n","but you have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and have caused Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab prostituted itself. You have also killed your brothers, your father’s family, who were better than you. \n   \n","So behold, the LORD is about to strike your people, your sons, your wives, and all your possessions with a serious blow. \n","And day after day you yourself will suffer from a severe illness, a disease of your bowels, until it causes your bowels to come out.’” \n   \n","Then the LORD stirred against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and Arabs who lived near the Cushites. \n","So they went to war against Judah, invaded it, and carried off all the possessions found in the king’s palace, along with his sons and wives; not a son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest. \n   \n","After all this, the LORD afflicted Jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels. \n","This continued day after day until two full years had passed. Finally, his intestines came out because of his disease, and he died in severe pain. And his people did not make a fire in his honor as they had done for his fathers. \n   \n","Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He died, to no one’s regret, and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. \n"],["Then the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, the youngest son of Jehoram, king in his place, since the raiders who had come into the camp with the Arabs  had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah. \n","Ahaziah was twenty-two  years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri. \n   \n","Ahaziah also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in wickedness. \n","And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for to his destruction they were his counselors after the death of his father. \n   \n","Ahaziah also followed their counsel and went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to fight against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans   wounded Joram; \n","so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramah   when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah  son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to visit Joram son of Ahab, because Joram had been wounded. \n   \n","Ahaziah’s downfall came from God when he went to visit Joram. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son  of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab. \n   \n","So while Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the rulers of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who were serving Ahaziah, and he killed them. \n   \n","Then Jehu looked for Ahaziah, and Jehu’s soldiers captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. So Ahaziah was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.” \n  So no one was left from the house of Ahaziah with the strength to rule the kingdom. \n   \n","When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to annihilate all the royal heirs of the house of Judah. \n","But Jehoshabeath  daughter of King Jehoram took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were being murdered, and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Because Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest, was Ahaziah’s sister, she hid Joash from Athaliah so that she could not kill him. \n   \n","And Joash remained hidden with them in the house of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land. \n"],["Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada strengthened himself and made a covenant with the commanders of hundreds—with Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri. \n","So they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the heads of the families of Israel.

You must stay close to the king wherever he goes.” \n   \n","So the Levites and all Judah did everything that Jehoiada the priest had ordered. Each of them took his men—those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty—for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions. \n","Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields of King David that were in the house of God. \n","He stationed all the troops, with their weapons in hand, surrounding the king by the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple. \n   \n","Then Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, presented him with the Testimony, and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted, “Long live the king!” \n   \n","When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king, she went out to them in the house of the LORD. \n","And she looked out and saw the king standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, while the singers with musical instruments were leading the praises. \n  Then Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed, “Treason, treason!” \n   \n","And Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of hundreds in charge of the army, saying, “Bring her out between the ranks, and put to the sword anyone who follows her.” For the priest had said, “She must not be put to death in the house of the LORD.” \n   \n","So they seized Athaliah as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate to the palace grounds, and there they put her to death. \n   \n","Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and the king and the people that they would be the LORD’s people. \n","So all the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols to pieces and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. \n   \n","Moreover, Jehoiada put the oversight of the house of the LORD into the hands of the Levitical priests, whom David had appointed over the house of the LORD, to offer burnt offerings to the LORD as is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and song, as ordained by David. \n","He stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD, so that nothing unclean could enter for any reason. \n   \n","He also took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD and entered the royal palace through the Upper Gate. They seated King Joash on the royal throne, \n","and all the people of the land rejoiced.

His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba. \n","And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest. \n","Jehoiada took for himself two wives, and he had sons and daughters. \n   \n","Some time later, Joash set his heart on repairing the house of the LORD. \n","So he gathered the priests and Levites and said, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the house of your God. Do it quickly.” \n  The Levites, however, did not make haste. \n","So the king called Jehoiada the high priest and said, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?” \n   \n","For the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the house of God and had even used the sacred objects of the house of the LORD for the Baals. \n   \n","At the king’s command a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the house of the LORD. \n","And a proclamation was issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they were to bring to the LORD the tax imposed by Moses the servant of God on Israel in the wilderness. \n","All the officers and all the people rejoiced and brought their contributions, and they dropped them in the chest until it was full. \n   \n","Whenever the chest was brought by the Levites to the king’s overseers and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal scribe and the officer of the high priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this daily and gathered the money in abundance. \n","Then the king and Jehoiada would give the money to those who supervised the labor on the house of the LORD to hire stonecutters and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, as well as workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the LORD. \n   \n","So the workmen labored, and in their hands the repair work progressed. They restored the house of God according to its specifications, and they reinforced it. \n","When they were finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada to make with it the articles for the house of the LORD—utensils for the service and for the burnt offerings, dishes, and other objects of gold and silver. \n  Throughout the days of Jehoiada, burnt offerings were presented regularly in the house of the LORD. \n   \n","When Jehoiada was old and full of years, he died at the age of 130. \n   \n","And Jehoiada was buried with the kings in the City of David, because he had done what was good in Israel for God and His temple. \n   \n","After the death of Jehoiada, however, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them. \n","They abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherah poles and idols. So wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs. \n","Nevertheless, the LORD sent prophets to bring the people back to Him and to testify against them; but they would not listen. \n   \n","Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood up before the people and said to them, “This is what God says: ‘Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, He has forsaken you.’” \n   \n","But they conspired against Zechariah, and by order of the king, they stoned him in the courtyard of the house of the LORD. \n   \n","Thus King Joash failed to remember the kindness that Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had extended to him. Instead, Joash killed Jehoiada’s son. As he lay dying, Zechariah said, “May the LORD see this and call you to account.” \n   \n","In the spring, the army of Aram went to war against Joash. They entered Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the leaders of the people, and they sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus. \n","Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men, the LORD delivered into their hand a very great army. Because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, judgment was executed on Joash. \n   \n","And when the Arameans had withdrawn, they left Joash severely wounded. His own servants conspired against him for shedding the blood of the son  of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him on his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. \n","Those who conspired against Joash were Zabad   son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad son of Shimrith  the Moabitess. \n   \n","The accounts of the sons of Joash, as well as the many pronouncements about him and about the restoration   of the house of God, are indeed written in the Treatise  of the Book of the Kings. And his son Amaziah reigned in his place. \n"],["Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem. \n","And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not wholeheartedly. \n   \n","As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, Amaziah executed the servants who had murdered his father the king. \n","Yet he did not put their sons to death, but acted according to what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded: “Fathers must not be put to death for their children, and children must not be put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.” \n   \n","Then Amaziah gathered the people of Judah and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and of hundreds. And he numbered those twenty years of age or older throughout Judah and Benjamin and found 300,000 chosen men able to serve in the army, bearing the spear and shield. \n   \n","He also hired 100,000 mighty warriors from Israel for a hundred talents of silver. \n","But a man of God came to him and said, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel—not with any of the Ephraimites. \n","Even if you go and fight bravely in battle, God will make you stumble before the enemy, for God has power to help and power to overthrow.” \n   \n","Amaziah asked the man of God, “What should I do about the hundred talents I have given to the army of Israel?” \n  And the man of God replied, “The LORD is able to give you much more than this.” \n   \n","So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. And they were furious with Judah and returned home in great anger. \n   \n","Amaziah, however, summoned his strength and led his troops to the Valley of Salt, where he struck down 10,000 men of Seir, \n","and the army of Judah also captured 10,000 men alive. They took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces. \n   \n","Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had dismissed from battle raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon. They struck down 3,000 people and carried off a great deal of plunder. \n   \n","When Amaziah returned from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the Seirites, set them up as his own gods, bowed before them, and burned sacrifices to them. \n","Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet, who said, “Why have you sought this people’s gods, which could not deliver them from your hand?” \n   \n","While he was still speaking, the king asked, “Have we made you the counselor to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?” \n  So the prophet stopped, but he said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.” \n   \n","Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent word to the king of Israel Jehoash  son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu. “Come, let us meet face to face,” he said. \n   \n","But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle. \n","You have said, ‘Look, I have defeated Edom,’ and your heart has become proud and boastful. Now stay at home. Why should you stir up trouble so that you fall—you and Judah with you?” \n   \n","But Amaziah would not listen, for this had come from God in order to deliver them into the hand of Jehoash, because they had sought the gods of Edom. \n","So Jehoash king of Israel advanced, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh in Judah. \n","And Judah was routed before Israel, and every man fled to his own home. \n   \n","There at Beth-shemesh, Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz. \n  Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section of four hundred cubits. \n","He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the house of God with Obed-edom and in the treasuries of the royal palace, as well as some hostages. Then he returned to Samaria. \n   \n","Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. \n","As for the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from beginning to end, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel? \n   \n","From the time that Amaziah turned from following the LORD, a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But men were sent after him to Lachish, and they killed him there. \n","They carried him back on horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah. \n"],["All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. \n","Uzziah was the one who rebuilt Eloth   and restored it to Judah after King Amaziah  rested with his fathers. \n   \n","Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem. \n","And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done. \n","He sought God throughout the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear  of God. And as long as he sought the LORD, God gave him success. \n   \n","Uzziah went out to wage war against the Philistines, and he tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. Then he built cities near Ashdod and among the Philistines. \n","God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs living in Gur-baal, and against the Meunites. \n","The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, for he had become exceedingly powerful. \n   \n","Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the angle in the wall, and he fortified them. \n","Since he had much livestock in the foothills  and in the plain, he built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns. And since he was a lover of the soil, he had farmers and vinedressers in the hill country and in the fertile fields. \n   \n","Uzziah had an army ready for battle that went out to war by assigned divisions, as recorded by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officers. \n","The total number of family leaders of the mighty men of valor was 2,600. \n","Under their authority was an army of 307,500 trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies. \n   \n","Uzziah supplied the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and slingstones. \n","And in Jerusalem he made skillfully designed devices to shoot  arrows and catapult large stones from the towers and corners. So his fame spread far and wide, for he was helped tremendously so that he became powerful. \n   \n","But when Uzziah grew powerful, his arrogance led to his own destruction. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, for he entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense. \n   \n","Then Azariah the priest, along with eighty brave priests of the LORD, went in after him. \n","They took their stand against King Uzziah and said, “Uzziah, you have no right to offer incense to the LORD. Only the priests, the descendants of Aaron, are consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have acted unfaithfully; you will not receive honor from the LORD God.” \n   \n","Uzziah, with a censer in his hand to offer incense, was enraged. But while he raged against the priests in their presence in the house of the LORD before the altar of incense, leprosy  broke out on his forehead. \n","When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him and saw his leprous forehead, they rushed him out. Indeed, he himself hurried to get out, because the LORD had afflicted him. \n   \n","So King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He lived in isolation, leprous and cut off from the house of the LORD, while his son Jotham had charge of the royal palace to govern the people of the land. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from beginning to end, they are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. \n","And Uzziah rested with his fathers and was buried near them  in a field of burial that belonged to the kings; for the people said, “He was a leper.” And his son Jotham reigned in his place. \n"],["Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother’s name was Jerushah  daughter of Zadok. \n","And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah  had done. In addition, he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still behaved corruptly. \n   \n","Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD, and he worked extensively on the wall at the hill of Ophel. \n","He also built cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and towers in the forests. \n   \n","Jotham waged war against the king of the Ammonites and defeated them, and that year they gave him a hundred talents of silver,  ten thousand cors of wheat,  and ten thousand cors of barley. They paid him the same in the second and third years. \n","So Jotham grew powerful because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Jotham, along with all his wars and his ways, they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. \n","He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. \n","And Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And his son Ahaz reigned in his place. \n"],["Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. And unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD. \n","Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even made cast images of the Baals. \n   \n","Moreover, Ahaz burned incense in the Valley of Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. \n","And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree. \n   \n","So the LORD his God delivered Ahaz into the hand of the king of Aram, who attacked him and took many captives to Damascus. \n  Ahaz was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with great force. \n","For in one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 valiant men in Judah. This happened because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. \n","Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the son of the king, Azrikam the governor of the palace, and Elkanah the second to the king. \n","Then the Israelites took 200,000 captives from their kinsmen—women, sons, and daughters. They also carried off a great deal of plunder and brought it to Samaria. \n   \n","But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army that returned to Samaria. “Look,” he said to them, “because of His wrath against Judah, the LORD, the God of your fathers, has delivered them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches up to heaven. \n","And now you intend to reduce to slavery the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem. But are you not also guilty before the LORD your God? \n","Now therefore, listen to me and return the captives you took from your kinsmen, for the fierce anger of the LORD is upon you.” \n   \n","Then some of the leaders of the Ephraimites  —Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—stood in opposition to those arriving from the war. \n","“You must not bring the captives here,” they said, “for you are proposing to bring guilt upon us from the LORD and to add to our sins and our guilt. For our guilt is great, and fierce anger is upon Israel.” \n   \n","So the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the leaders and all the assembly. \n","Then the men who were designated by name arose, took charge of the captives, and provided from the plunder clothing for the naked. They clothed them, gave them sandals and food and drink, anointed their wounds, and put all the feeble on donkeys. So they brought them to Jericho, the City of Palms, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria. \n   \n","At that time King Ahaz sent for help from the king  of Assyria. \n","The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away captives. \n","The Philistines had also raided the cities of the foothills  and the Negev of Judah, capturing and occupying Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, and Gederoth, as well as Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo with their villages. \n","For the LORD humbled Judah because Ahaz king of Israel  had thrown off restraint in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the LORD. \n   \n","Then Tiglath-pileser  king of Assyria came to Ahaz but afflicted him rather than strengthening him. \n","Although Ahaz had taken a portion from the house of the LORD, from the royal palace, and from the princes and had presented it to the king of Assyria, it did not help him. \n   \n","In the time of his distress, King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD. \n","Since Damascus had defeated him, he sacrificed to their gods and said, “Because the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.” But these gods were the downfall of Ahaz and of all Israel. \n   \n","Then Ahaz gathered up the articles of the house of God, cut them into pieces, shut the doors of the house of the LORD, and set up altars of his own on every street corner in Jerusalem. \n","In every city of Judah he built high places to offer incense to other gods, and so he provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Ahaz and all his ways, from beginning to end, they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. \n","And Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And his son Hezekiah reigned in his place. \n"],["Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. \n","And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father David had done. \n   \n","In the first month of the first year of his reign, Hezekiah opened and repaired the doors of the house of the LORD. \n","Then he brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in the square on the east side. \n   \n","“Listen to me, O Levites,” he said. “Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers. Remove from the Holy Place every impurity. \n   \n","For our fathers were unfaithful and did evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They abandoned Him, turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD, and turned their backs on Him. \n","They also shut the doors of the portico and extinguished the lamps. They did not burn incense or present burnt offerings in the Holy Place of the God of Israel. \n   \n","Therefore, the wrath of the LORD has fallen upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, horror, and mockery, as you can see with your own eyes. \n","For behold, this is why our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and daughters and wives are in captivity. \n   \n","Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that His fierce anger will turn away from us. \n","Now, my sons, do not be negligent, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, to minister before Him, and to burn incense.” \n   \n","Then the Levites set to work: \n  Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Kohathites; \n  Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the Merarites; \n  Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershonites; \n   \n","Shimri and Jeuel from the Elizaphanites; \n  Zechariah and Mattaniah from the Asaphites; \n   \n","Jehiel and Shimei from the Hemanites; \n  and Shemaiah and Uzziel from the Jeduthunites. \n   \n","When they had assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves, they went in to cleanse the house of the LORD, according to the command of the king by the words of the LORD. \n   \n","So the priests went inside the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and they brought out to the courtyard all the unclean things that they found in the temple of the LORD. Then the Levites took these things and carried them out to the Kidron Valley. \n","They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the LORD. For eight more days they consecrated the house of the LORD itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month. \n   \n","Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported, “We have cleansed the entire house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table of the showbread with all its utensils. \n","Moreover, we have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz in his unfaithfulness cast aside during his reign. They are now in front of the altar of the LORD.” \n   \n","Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials and went up to the house of the LORD. \n","They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And the king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the LORD. \n   \n","So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. And they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. \n   \n","Then they brought the goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, who laid their hands on them. \n","And the priests slaughtered the goats and put their blood on the altar for a sin offering, to make atonement for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel. \n   \n","Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres according to the command of David, of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet. For the command had come from the LORD through His prophets. \n","The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. \n   \n","And Hezekiah ordered that the burnt offering be sacrificed on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD and the trumpets began as well, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel. \n","The whole assembly was worshiping, the singers were singing, and the trumpeters were playing. All this continued until the burnt offering was completed. \n   \n","When the offerings were completed, the king and all those present with him bowed down and worshiped. \n","Then King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to the LORD in the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped. \n   \n","Then Hezekiah said, “Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.” \n  So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings. \n","The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD. \n","And the consecrated offerings were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep. \n   \n","However, since there were not enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings, their Levite brothers helped them until the work was finished and until the priests had been consecrated. For the Levites had been more diligent in consecrating themselves than the priests had been. \n   \n","Furthermore, the burnt offerings were abundant, along with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of the LORD was established. \n","Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had prepared for the people, because everything had been accomplished so quickly. \n"],["Then Hezekiah sent word throughout all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh inviting them to come to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem to keep the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel. \n","For the king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem had decided to keep the Passover in the second month, \n","since they had been unable to observe it at the regular time, because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not been gathered in Jerusalem. \n   \n","This proposal pleased the king and the whole assembly. \n","So they established a decree to circulate a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that the people should come to keep the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel, in Jerusalem. For they had not observed it as a nation as prescribed. \n   \n","So the couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his officials, which read: \n  “Children of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that He may return to those of you who remain, who have escaped the grasp of the kings of Assyria. \n","Do not be like your fathers and brothers who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their fathers, so that He made them an object of horror, as you can see. \n   \n","Now do not stiffen your necks as your fathers did. Submit to the LORD and come to His sanctuary, which He has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God, so that His fierce anger will turn away from you. \n","For if you return to the LORD, your brothers and sons will receive mercy in the presence of their captors and will return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful; He will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.” \n   \n","And the couriers traveled from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun; but the people scorned and mocked them. \n","Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. \n","Moreover, the power of God was on the people in Judah to give them one heart to obey the command of the king and his officials according to the word of the LORD. \n   \n","In the second month, a very great assembly gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. \n","They proceeded to remove the altars in Jerusalem and to take away the incense altars and throw them into the Kidron Valley. \n","And on the fourteenth day of the second month they slaughtered the Passover lamb. The priests and Levites were ashamed, and they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of the LORD. \n   \n","They stood at their prescribed posts, according to the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood, which they received from the hand of the Levites. \n","Since there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves, the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for every unclean person to consecrate the lambs to the LORD. \n   \n","A large number of the people—many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun—had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah interceded for them, saying, “May the LORD, who is good, provide atonement for everyone \n","who sets his heart on seeking God—the LORD, the God of his fathers—even if he is not cleansed according to the purification rules of the sanctuary.” \n   \n","And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people. \n","The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy, and the Levites and priests praised the LORD day after day, accompanied by loud instruments of praise to the LORD. \n","And Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites who performed skillfully before the LORD. For seven days they ate their assigned portion, sacrificing fellowship offerings and giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers. \n   \n","The whole assembly agreed to observe seven more days, so they observed seven days with joy. \n","For Hezekiah king of Judah contributed a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the assembly, and the officials contributed a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep for the assembly, and a great number of priests consecrated themselves. \n   \n","Then the whole assembly of Judah rejoiced along with the priests and Levites and the whole assembly that had come from Israel, including the foreigners who had come from Israel and those who lived in Judah. \n","So there was great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for nothing like this had happened there since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel. \n   \n","Then the priests and the Levites stood to bless the people, and God heard their voice, and their prayer came into His holy dwelling place in heaven. \n"],["When all this had ended, the Israelites in attendance went out to the cities of Judah and broke up the sacred pillars, chopped down the Asherah poles, and tore down the high places and altars throughout Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the Israelites returned to their cities, each to his own property. \n   \n","Hezekiah reestablished the divisions of the priests and Levites—each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites—for the burnt offerings and peace offerings, for ministry, for giving thanks, and for singing praises at the gates of the LORD’s dwelling. \n   \n","The king contributed from his own possessions for the regular morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts, as written in the Law of the LORD. \n","Moreover, he commanded the people living in Jerusalem to make a contribution for the priests and Levites so that they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD. \n   \n","As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously provided the firstfruits of the grain, new wine, oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field, and they brought in an abundance—a tithe of everything. \n","And the Israelites and Judahites who lived in the cities of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things consecrated to the LORD their God, and they laid them in large heaps. \n   \n","In the third month they began building up the heaps, and they finished in the seventh month. \n","When Hezekiah and his officials came and viewed the heaps, they blessed the LORD and His people Israel. \n   \n","Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and Levites about the heaps, \n","and Azariah, the chief priest of the household of Zadok, answered him, “Since the people began to bring their contributions into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and there is plenty left over, because the LORD has blessed His people; this great abundance is what is left over.” \n   \n","Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare storerooms in the house of the LORD, and they did so. \n","And they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes, and dedicated gifts. Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them, and his brother Shimei was second. \n","Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the authority of Conaniah and his brother Shimei, by appointment of King Hezekiah and of Azariah the chief official of the house of God. \n   \n","Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions to the LORD and the consecrated gifts. \n","Under his authority, Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah faithfully distributed portions to their fellow priests in their cities, according to their divisions, old and young alike. \n   \n","In addition, they distributed portions to the males registered by genealogy who were three years of age or older—to all who would enter the house of the LORD for their daily duties for service in the responsibilities of their divisions—\n","and to the priests enrolled according to their families in the genealogy, as well as to the Levites twenty years of age or older, according to their duties and divisions. \n","The genealogy included all the little ones, wives, sons, and daughters in the whole assembly. For they had faithfully consecrated themselves as holy. \n   \n","As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farmlands around each of their cities or in any other city, men were designated by name to distribute a portion to every male among the priests and to every Levite listed by the genealogies. \n   \n","So this is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He did what was good and upright and true before the LORD his God. \n","He was diligent in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law and the commandments, in order to seek his God. And so he prospered. \n"],["After all these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, intending to conquer them for himself. \n   \n","When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come to make war against Jerusalem, \n","he consulted with his leaders and commanders about stopping up the waters of the springs outside the city, and they helped him carry it out. \n","Many people assembled and stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings  of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” they said. \n   \n","Then Hezekiah worked resolutely to rebuild all the broken sections of the wall and to raise up towers on it. He also built an outer wall and reinforced the supporting terraces  of the City of David, and he produced an abundance of weapons and shields. \n   \n","Hezekiah appointed military commanders over the people and gathered the people in the square of the city gate. Then he encouraged them, saying, \n","“Be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged before the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater One with us than with him. \n","With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles.” \n  So the people were strengthened by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. \n   \n","Later, as Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces besieged Lachish, he sent his servants to Jerusalem with a message for King Hezekiah of Judah and all the people of Judah who were in Jerusalem: \n","“This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: What is the basis of your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege? \n","Is not Hezekiah misleading you to give you over to death by famine and thirst when he says, ‘The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?’ \n","Did not Hezekiah himself remove His high places and His altars and say to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn sacrifices’? \n   \n","Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Have the gods of these nations ever been able to deliver their land from my hand? \n","Who among all the gods of these nations that my fathers devoted to destruction  has been able to deliver his people from my hand? How then can your God deliver you from my hand? \n   \n","So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive you, and do not let him mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand!” \n   \n","And the servants of Sennacherib spoke further against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah. \n","He also wrote letters mocking the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying against Him: “Just as the gods of the nations did not deliver their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.” \n   \n","Then the Assyrians called out loudly in Hebrew  to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them in order to capture the city. \n","They spoke against the God of Jerusalem as they had spoken against the gods of the peoples of the earth—the work of human hands. \n   \n","In response, King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out to heaven in prayer, \n","and the LORD sent an angel who annihilated every mighty man of valor and every leader and commander in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he entered the temple of his god, some of his own sons struck him down with the sword. \n   \n","So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hands of King Sennacherib of Assyria and all the others, and He gave them rest on every side. \n","Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the LORD and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah, and from then on he was exalted in the eyes of all nations. \n   \n","In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. So he prayed to the LORD, who spoke to him and gave him a sign. \n","But because his heart was proud, Hezekiah did not repay the favor shown to him. Therefore wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem. \n   \n","Then Hezekiah humbled the pride of his heart—he and the people of Jerusalem—so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them during the days of Hezekiah. \n   \n","Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable articles. \n","He also made storehouses for the harvest of grain and new wine and oil, stalls for all kinds of livestock, and pens for the flocks. \n","He made cities for himself, and he acquired herds of sheep and cattle in abundance, for God gave him very great wealth. \n   \n","It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Spring of Gihon and channeled it down to the west side of the City of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all that he did. \n","And so when ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon were sent to him to inquire about the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him alone to test him, that He might know all that was in Hezekiah’s heart. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of loving devotion, they are indeed written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. \n","And Hezekiah rested with his fathers and was buried in the upper tombs of David’s descendants. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem paid him honor at his death. And his son Manasseh reigned in his place. \n"],["Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. \n","And he did evil in the sight of the LORD by following the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. \n","For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had torn down, and he raised up altars for the Baals and made Asherah poles. And he worshiped and served all the host of heaven. \n   \n","Manasseh also built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever.” \n","In both courtyards of the house of the LORD, he built altars to all the host of heaven. \n","He sacrificed his sons in the fire  in the Valley of Hinnom. He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did great evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger. \n   \n","Manasseh even took the carved image he had made and set it up in the house of God, of which God had said to David and his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will establish My Name forever. \n","I will never again cause the feet of the Israelites to leave the land that I assigned to your fathers, if only they are careful to do all that I have commanded them through Moses—all the laws, statutes, and judgments.” \n   \n","So Manasseh led the people of Judah and Jerusalem astray, so that they did greater evil than the nations that the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites. \n   \n","And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they did not listen. \n","So the LORD brought against them the military commanders of the king of Assyria, who captured Manasseh, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon. \n","And in his distress, Manasseh sought the favor of the LORD his God and earnestly humbled himself before the God of his fathers. \n","And when he prayed to Him, the LORD received his plea and heard his petition; so He brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God. \n   \n","After this, Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David from west of Gihon in the valley to the entrance of the Fish Gate, and he brought it around the hill of Ophel and heightened it considerably. He also stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah. \n   \n","He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, along with all the altars he had built on the temple mount  and in Jerusalem, and he dumped them outside the city. \n","Then he restored the altar of the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it, and he told Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel. \n","Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed at the high places, but only to the LORD their God. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Manasseh, along with his prayer to his God and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, they are indeed written in the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. \n","His prayer and how God received his plea, as well as all his sin and unfaithfulness, and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself, they are indeed written in the Records of the Seers. \n","And Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried at his palace. And his son Amon reigned in his place. \n   \n","Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. \n","And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done. \n  Amon served and sacrificed to all the idols that his father Manasseh had made, \n","but he did not humble himself before the LORD as his father Manasseh had done; instead, Amon increased his guilt. \n   \n","Then the servants of Amon conspired against him and killed him in his palace. \n","But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place. \n"],["Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. \n","And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right or to the left. \n   \n","In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, Josiah began to seek the God of his father David, and in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images. \n","Then in his presence the altars of the Baals were torn down, and he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them. He shattered the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images, crushed them to dust, and scattered them over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. \n","Then he burned the bones of the priests on their altars. So he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. \n   \n","Josiah did the same in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins  around them. \n","He tore down the altars and Asherah poles, crushed the idols to powder, and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem. \n   \n","Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, in order to cleanse the land and the temple, Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God. \n   \n","So they went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites at the doors had collected from the people of Manasseh and Ephraim, from all the remnant of Israel, Judah, and Benjamin, and from the people of Jerusalem. \n","They put it into the hands of the supervisors of those doing the work of the house of the LORD, who in turn gave it to the workmen restoring and repairing the house of the LORD. \n","They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to buy dressed stone, as well as timbers for couplings and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to deteriorate. \n   \n","And the men did the work faithfully. The Levites overseeing them were Jahath and Obadiah, descendants of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descendants of Kohath. Other Levites, all skilled with musical instruments, \n","were over the laborers and supervised all who did the work, task by task. Some of the Levites were secretaries, officers, and gatekeepers. \n   \n","While they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD written by  Moses. \n","And Hilkiah said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD!” And he gave it to Shaphan. \n   \n","Then Shaphan brought the book to the king and reported, “Your servants are doing all that has been placed in their hands. \n","They have paid out the money that was found in the house of the LORD and have put it into the hands of the supervisors and workers.” \n   \n","Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king. \n   \n","When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his clothes \n","and commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon   son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king: \n","“Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for those remaining in Israel and Judah concerning the words in the book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that has been poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD by doing all that is written in this book.” \n   \n","So Hilkiah and those the king had designated went and spoke to Huldah   the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath,  the son of Hasrah,  the keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District. \n   \n","And Huldah said to them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Tell the man who sent you \n","that this is what the LORD says: I am about to bring calamity on this place and on its people, according to all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah, \n","because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. My wrath will be poured out upon this place and will not be quenched.’ \n   \n","But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, tell him that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘As for the words that you heard, \n","because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its people, and because you have humbled yourself before Me and you have torn your clothes and wept before Me, I have heard you,’ declares the LORD. \n   \n","‘Now I will indeed gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants.’” \n  So they brought her answer back to the king. \n   \n","Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. \n","And he went up to the house of the LORD with all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the priests and the Levites—all the people small and great—and in their hearing he read all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. \n   \n","So the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD to follow the LORD and to keep His commandments, decrees, and statutes with all his heart and all his soul, and to carry out the words of this covenant that were written in this book. \n   \n","Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin take a stand in agreement to it. So all the people of Jerusalem carried out the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. \n   \n","And Josiah removed all the abominations from all the lands belonging to the Israelites, and he required everyone in Israel to serve the LORD their God. Throughout his reign they did not turn aside from following the LORD, the God of their fathers. \n"],["Then Josiah celebrated the Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month. \n","He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD. \n   \n","To the Levites who taught all Israel and were holy to the LORD, Josiah said: “Put the holy ark in the temple built by Solomon son of David king of Israel. It is not to be carried around on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and His people Israel. \n","Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions, according to the instructions written by David king of Israel and Solomon his son. \n   \n","Moreover, stand in the Holy Place by the divisions of the families of your kinsmen the lay people, and by the divisions of the families of the Levites. \n","Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves, and make preparations for your fellow countrymen to carry out the word of the LORD given by  Moses.” \n   \n","From his own flocks and herds Josiah contributed 30,000 lambs and goats plus 3,000 bulls for the Passover offerings for all the people who were present. \n   \n","His officials also contributed willingly to the people and priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the administrators of the house of God, gave the priests 2,600 Passover offerings and 300 bulls. \n","Additionally, Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, officers of the Levites, donated to the Levites 5,000 Passover offerings and 500 bulls. \n   \n","So the service was prepared; the priests stood in their places and the Levites in their divisions according to the king’s command. \n","And they slaughtered the Passover lambs, while the priests sprinkled the blood handed to them and the Levites skinned the animals. \n","They set aside the burnt offerings to be given to the divisions of the families of the people to offer to the LORD, as is written in the Book of Moses; and they did the same with the bulls. \n   \n","They roasted the Passover animals on the fire according to the regulation, and they boiled the other holy offerings in pots, kettles, and bowls and quickly brought them to all the people. \n","Afterward, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, since the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were offering up burnt offerings and fat until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron. \n   \n","The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were at their stations according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer. And the gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their position, because their fellow Levites made preparations for them. \n   \n","So on that day the entire service of the LORD was carried out for celebrating the Passover and offering burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josiah. \n","The Israelites who were present also observed the Passover at that time, as well as the Feast of Unleavened Bread  for seven days. \n","No such Passover had been observed in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel ever observed a Passover like the one that Josiah observed with the priests, the Levites, all Judah, the Israelites who were present, and the people of Jerusalem. \n","In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, this Passover was observed. \n   \n","After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco king of Egypt marched up to fight at Carchemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to confront him. \n","But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, “What is the issue between you and me, O king of Judah? I have not come against you today, but I am fighting another dynasty. God told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or He will destroy you!” \n   \n","Josiah, however, did not turn away from him; instead, in order to engage him in battle, he disguised himself. He did not listen to Neco’s words from the mouth of God, but went to fight him on the Plain of Megiddo. \n","There the archers shot King Josiah, who said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly wounded!” \n   \n","So his servants took him out of his chariot, put him in his second chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. And Josiah was buried in the tomb of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him. \n   \n","Then Jeremiah lamented over Josiah, and to this day all the choirs of men and women sing laments over Josiah. They established them as a statute for Israel, and indeed they are written in the Book of Laments. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Josiah, along with his deeds of loving devotion according to what is written in the Law of the LORD—\n","his acts from beginning to end—they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. \n"],["Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father. \n   \n","Jehoahaz  was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. \n","And the king of Egypt dethroned him in Jerusalem and imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver   and a talent of gold. \n   \n","Then Neco king of Egypt made Eliakim brother of Jehoahaz king over Judah and Jerusalem, and he changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Eliakim’s brother Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt. \n   \n","Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God. \n   \n","Then Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jehoiakim and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon. \n","Nebuchadnezzar also took to Babylon some of the articles from the house of the LORD, and he put them in his temple  in Babylon. \n   \n","As for the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the abominations he committed, and all that was found against him, they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. And his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place. \n   \n","Jehoiachin was eighteen  years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD. \n   \n","In the spring,  King Nebuchadnezzar summoned Jehoiachin and brought him to Babylon, along with the articles of value from the house of the LORD. And he made Jehoiachin’s relative  Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem. \n   \n","Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. \n","And he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke for the LORD. \n   \n","He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. But Zedekiah stiffened his neck and hardened  his heart against turning to the LORD, the God of Israel. \n","Furthermore, all the leaders of the priests and the people multiplied their unfaithful deeds, following all the abominations of the nations, and they defiled the house of the LORD, which He had consecrated in Jerusalem. \n   \n","Again and again  the LORD, the God of their fathers, sent word to His people through His messengers because He had compassion on them and on His dwelling place. \n","But they mocked the messengers of God, despising His words and scoffing at His prophets, until the wrath of the LORD against His people was stirred up beyond remedy. \n   \n","So He brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who put their young men to the sword in the sanctuary, sparing neither young men nor young women, neither elderly nor infirm. God gave them all into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, \n","who carried off everything to Babylon—all the articles of the house of God, both large and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king and his officials. \n","Then the Chaldeans set fire to the house of God and broke down the wall of Jerusalem. They burned down all the palaces and destroyed every article of value. \n   \n","Those who escaped the sword were carried by Nebuchadnezzar into exile in Babylon, and they became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia came to power. \n   \n","So the land enjoyed its Sabbath rest all the days of the desolation, until seventy years were completed, in fulfillment of the word of the LORD through Jeremiah. \n   \n","In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah, the LORD stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia to send a proclamation throughout his kingdom and to put it in writing as follows: \n   \n","“This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: \n  ‘The LORD, the God of heaven, who has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, has appointed me to build a house for Him at Jerusalem in Judah. \n  Whoever among you belongs to His people, may the LORD his God be with him, and may he go up.’” "]],"Ezra":[["In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah, the LORD stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia to send a proclamation throughout his kingdom and to put it in writing as follows: \n   \n","“This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: \n  ‘The LORD, the God of heaven, who has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, has appointed me to build a house for Him at Jerusalem in Judah. \n   \n","Whoever among you belongs to His people, may his God be with him, and may he go to Jerusalem in Judah and build the house of the LORD, the God of Israel; He is the God who is in Jerusalem. \n","And let every survivor, wherever he lives, be assisted by the men of that region with silver, gold, goods, and livestock, along with a freewill offering for the house of God in Jerusalem.’” \n   \n","So the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites—everyone whose spirit God had stirred—prepared to go up and rebuild the house of the LORD in Jerusalem. \n   \n","And all their neighbors supported them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuables, in addition to all their freewill offerings. \n   \n","King Cyrus also brought out the articles belonging to the house of the LORD that Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and placed in the temple of his gods. \n","Cyrus king of Persia had them brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah. \n","This was the inventory: \n  30 gold dishes, \n  1,000 silver dishes, \n  29 silver utensils, \n   \n","30 gold bowls, \n  410 matching silver bowls, \n  and 1,000 other articles. \n   \n","In all, there were 5,400 gold and silver articles.

Separate yourselves from the people of the land and from your foreign wives.” \n   \n","And the whole assembly responded in a loud voice: “Truly we must do as you say! \n","But there are many people here, and it is the rainy season. We are not able to stay out in the open. Nor is this the work of one or two days, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter. \n","Let our leaders represent the whole assembly.

Will they complete it in a day? Can they bring these burnt stones back to life from the mounds of rubble?” \n   \n","Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside him, said, “If even a fox were to climb up on what they are building, it would break down their wall of stones!” \n   \n","Hear us, O God, for we are despised.

I stationed them by families with their swords, spears, and bows. \n   \n","After I had made an inspection, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.” \n   \n","When our enemies heard that we were aware of their scheme and that God had frustrated it, each of us returned to his own work on the wall. \n","And from that day on, half of my servants did the work while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armor. \n  The officers stationed themselves behind all the people of Judah \n","who were rebuilding the wall. The laborers who carried materials worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other. \n","And each of the builders worked with his sword strapped at his side. But the trumpeter stayed beside me. \n   \n","Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: “The work is great and extensive, and we are spread out far from one another along the wall. \n","Wherever you hear the sound of the horn, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us!” \n   \n","So we continued the work, while half of the men held spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out. \n","At that time I also said to the people, “Let every man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they can stand guard by night and work by day.” \n   \n","So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the guards with me changed out of our clothes; each carried his weapon, even to go for water. \n"],["About that time there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their fellow Jews. \n   \n","Some were saying, “We and our sons and daughters are numerous. We must get grain in order to eat and stay alive.” \n   \n","Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our homes to get grain during the famine.” \n   \n","Still others were saying, “We have borrowed money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards. \n","We and our children are just like our countrymen and their children, yet we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters are already enslaved, but we are powerless to redeem them because our fields and vineyards belong to others.” \n   \n","When I heard their outcry and these complaints, I became extremely angry, \n","and after serious thought I rebuked the nobles and officials, saying, “You are exacting usury from your own brothers!” \n  So I called a large assembly against them \n","and said, “We have done our best to buy back our Jewish brothers who were sold to foreigners, but now you are selling your own brothers, that they may be sold back to us!” \n  But they remained silent, for they could find nothing to say. \n   \n","So I continued, “What you are doing is not right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our foreign enemies? \n","I, as well as my brothers and my servants, have been lending the people money and grain. Please, let us stop this usury. \n","Please restore to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses, along with the percentage of the money, grain, new wine, and oil that you have been assessing them.” \n   \n","“We will restore it,” they replied, “and will require nothing more from them. We will do as you say.” \n  So I summoned the priests and required of the nobles and officials an oath that they would do what they had promised. \n","I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, “May God likewise shake out of His house and possession every man who does not keep this promise. May such a man be shaken out and have nothing!” \n  The whole assembly said, “Amen,” and they praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised. \n   \n","Furthermore, from the day King Artaxerxes appointed me to be their governor in the land of Judah, from his twentieth year until his thirty-second year (twelve years total), neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor. \n   \n","The governors before me had heavily burdened the people, taking from them bread and wine plus forty shekels of silver. Their servants also oppressed the people, but I did not do this because of my fear of God. \n","Instead, I devoted myself to the construction of the wall, and all my servants were gathered there for the work; we did not acquire any land. \n   \n","There were 150 Jews and officials at my table, besides the guests from the surrounding nations. \n","Each day one ox, six choice sheep, and some fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine was provided. But I did not demand the food allotted to the governor, because the burden on the people was so heavy. \n   \n","Remember me favorably, O my God, for all that I have done for this people. \n"],["When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left—though to that time I had not yet installed the doors in the gates—\n","Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages   on the plain  of Ono.” \n  But they were planning to harm me. \n   \n","So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to go down to you?” \n   \n","Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave the same reply. \n   \n","The fifth time, Sanballat sent me this same message by his young servant, who had in his hand an unsealed letter \n","that read: \n  “It is reported among the nations—and Geshem  agrees—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and this is why you are building the wall. According to these reports, you are to become their king, \n","and you have even appointed prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf: ‘There is a king in Judah.’ Soon these rumors will reach the ears of the king. So come, let us confer together.” \n   \n","Then I sent him this reply: “There is nothing to these rumors you are spreading; you are inventing them in your own mind.” \n   \n","For they were all trying to frighten us, saying, “Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will never be finished.” \n  But now, my God, strengthen my hands. \n   \n","Later, I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was confined to his house. He said: \n  “Let us meet at the house of God \n inside the temple. \n Let us shut the temple doors \n because they are coming to kill you—\n by night they are coming to kill you!” \n   \n","But I replied, “Should a man like me run away? Should one like me go into the temple to save his own life? I will not go!” \n   \n","I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had uttered this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. \n","He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would sin by doing as he suggested, so they could give me a bad name in order to discredit me. \n   \n","O my God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who tried to intimidate me. \n   \n","So the wall was completed in fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth of Elul. \n","When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and disheartened, for they realized that this task had been accomplished by our God. \n   \n","Also in those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came back to them. \n","For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, since he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. \n   \n","Moreover, these nobles kept reporting to me Tobiah’s good deeds, and they relayed my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me. \n"],["When the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were appointed. \n   \n","Then I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah the commander of the fortress, because he was a faithful man who feared God more than most. \n","And I told them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. While the guards are on duty, keep the doors shut and securely fastened.

All kinds of goods were being brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them against selling food on that day. \n","Additionally, men of Tyre who lived there were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem. \n   \n","Then I rebuked the nobles of Judah and asked, “What is this evil you are doing—profaning the Sabbath day? \n","Did not your forefathers do the same things, so that our God brought all this disaster on us and on this city? And now you are rekindling His wrath against Israel by profaning the Sabbath!” \n   \n","When the evening shadows began to fall on the gates of Jerusalem, just before the Sabbath, I ordered that the gates be shut and not opened until after the Sabbath. I posted some of my servants at the gates so that no load could enter on the Sabbath day. \n   \n","Once or twice, the merchants and those who sell all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem, \n","but I warned them, “Why are you camping in front of the wall? If you do it again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on, they did not return on the Sabbath. \n","Then I instructed the Levites to purify themselves and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. \n  Remember me for this as well, O my God, and show me mercy according to Your abundant loving devotion. \n   \n","In those days I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. \n","Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or of the other peoples, but could not speak the language of Judah. \n","I rebuked them and called down curses on them. I beat some of these men and pulled out their hair. \n  Then I made them take an oath before God and said, “You must not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters as wives for your sons or for yourselves! \n","Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in matters like this? There was not a king like him among many nations, and he was loved by his God, who made him king over all Israel—yet foreign women drew him into sin. \n","Must we now hear that you too are doing all this terrible evil and acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?” \n   \n","Even one of the sons of Jehoiada son of Eliashib the high priest had become a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. Therefore I drove him away from me. \n   \n","Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites. \n   \n","Thus I purified the priests and Levites from everything foreign, and I assigned specific duties to each of the priests and Levites. \n","I also arranged for contributions of wood at the appointed times, and for the firstfruits. \n  Remember me, O my God, with favor.

The military leaders of Persia and Media were there, along with the nobles and princes of the provinces. \n","And for a full 180 days he displayed the glorious riches of his kingdom and the magnificent splendor of his greatness. \n   \n","At the end of this time, in the garden court of the royal palace, the king held a seven-day feast for all the people in the citadel of Susa, from the least to the greatest. \n","Hangings of white and blue linen were fastened with cords of fine white and purple material to silver rings on the marble pillars. Gold and silver couches were arranged on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other costly stones. \n   \n","Beverages were served in an array of goblets of gold, each with a different design, and the royal wine flowed freely, according to the king’s bounty. \n","By order of the king, no limit was placed on the drinking, and every official of his household was to serve each man whatever he desired. \n   \n","Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes. \n   \n","On the seventh day, when the king’s heart was merry with wine, he ordered the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas—\n","to bring Queen Vashti before him, wearing her royal crown, to display her beauty to the people and officials. For she was beautiful to behold. \n   \n","Queen Vashti, however, refused to come at the king’s command brought by his eunuchs. And the king became furious, and his anger burned within him. \n   \n","Then the king consulted the wise men who knew the times, for it was customary for him to confer with the experts in law and justice. \n","His closest advisors were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who had personal access to the king and ranked highest in the kingdom. \n   \n","“According to law,” he asked, “what should be done with Queen Vashti, since she refused to obey the command of King Xerxes delivered by the eunuchs?” \n   \n","And in the presence of the king and his princes, Memucan replied, “Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king, but all the princes and the peoples in all the provinces of King Xerxes. \n","For the conduct of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to despise their husbands  and say, ‘King Xerxes ordered Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she did not come.’ \n   \n","This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard about the queen’s conduct will say the same thing to all the king’s officials, resulting in much contempt and wrath. \n   \n","So if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree, and let it be recorded in the laws of Persia and Media so that it cannot be repealed, that Vashti shall never again enter the presence of King Xerxes, and that her royal position shall be given to a woman better than she. \n","The edict the king issues will be heard throughout his vast kingdom—and so all women, from the least to the greatest, will honor their husbands.” \n   \n","The king and his princes were pleased with this counsel; so the king did as Memucan had advised. \n","He sent letters to all the provinces of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, proclaiming  that every man should be master of his own household. \n"],["Some time later, when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done, and what had been decreed against her. \n   \n","Then the king’s attendants proposed, “Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king, \n","and let the king appoint commissioners in each province of his kingdom to assemble all the beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women, and let them be given beauty treatments. \n","Then let the young woman who pleases the king become queen in place of Vashti.” \n  This suggestion pleased the king, and he acted accordingly. \n   \n","Now there was at the citadel of Susa a Jewish man from the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish. \n","He had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon among those taken captive with Jeconiah  king of Judah. \n   \n","And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah (that is, Esther), the daughter of his uncle, because she did not have a father or mother. The young woman was lovely in form and appearance, and when her father and mother had died, Mordecai had taken her in as his own daughter. \n   \n","When the king’s command and edict had been proclaimed, many young women gathered at the citadel of Susa under the care of Hegai. Esther was also taken to the palace and placed under the care of Hegai, the custodian of the women. \n","And the young woman pleased him and obtained his favor, so he quickly provided her with beauty treatments and the special diet. He assigned to her seven select maidservants from the palace and transferred her with them to the best place in the harem. \n   \n","Esther did not reveal her people or her lineage, because Mordecai had instructed her not to do so. \n","And every day Mordecai would walk back and forth in front of the court of the harem to learn about Esther’s welfare and what was happening to her. \n   \n","In the twelve months before her turn to go to King Xerxes, the harem regulation required each young woman to receive beauty treatments with oil of myrrh for six months, and then with perfumes and cosmetics for another six months. \n","When the young woman would go to the king, she was given whatever she requested to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace. \n","She would go there in the evening, and in the morning she would return to a second harem  under the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he delighted in her and summoned her by name. \n   \n","Now Esther was the daughter of Abihail, the uncle from whom Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter. And when it was her turn to go to the king, she did not ask for anything except what Hegai, the king’s trusted official in charge of the harem, had advised. And Esther found favor in the eyes of everyone who saw her. \n   \n","She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. \n   \n","And the king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she found grace and favor in his sight more than all of the other virgins. So he placed the royal crown upon her head and made her queen in place of Vashti. \n   \n","Then the king held a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his officials and servants. He proclaimed a tax holiday in the provinces and gave gifts worthy of the king’s bounty. \n   \n","When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate. \n","Esther still had not revealed her lineage or her people, just as Mordecai had instructed. She obeyed Mordecai’s command, as she had done under his care. \n   \n","In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan  and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the entrance, grew angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes. \n   \n","When Mordecai learned of the plot, he reported it to Queen Esther, and she informed the king on Mordecai’s behalf. \n   \n","After the report had been investigated and verified, both officials were hanged on the gallows. And all this was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles  in the presence of the king. \n"],["After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him to a position above all the princes who were with him. \n","All the royal servants at the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, because the king had commanded that this be done for him. But Mordecai would not bow down or pay homage. \n   \n","Then the royal servants at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the command of the king?” \n   \n","Day after day they warned him, but he would not comply. So they reported it to Haman to see whether Mordecai’s behavior would be tolerated, since he had told them he was a Jew. \n   \n","When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down or pay him homage, he was filled with rage. \n","And when he learned the identity of Mordecai’s people, he scorned the notion of  laying hands on Mordecai alone. Instead, he sought to destroy all of Mordecai’s people, the Jews, throughout the kingdom of Xerxes. \n   \n","In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan,  the Pur (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman to determine a day and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar. \n   \n","Then Haman informed King Xerxes, “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples of every province of your kingdom. Their laws are different from everyone else’s, and they do not obey the king’s laws. So it is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them. \n","If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will deposit ten thousand talents of silver  into the royal treasury to pay those who carry it out.” \n   \n","So the king removed the signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. \n","“Keep your money,” said the king to Haman. “These people are given to you to do with them as you please.” \n   \n","On the thirteenth day of the first month, the royal scribes were summoned and the order was written exactly as Haman commanded the royal satraps, the governors of each province, and the officials of each people, in the script of each province and the language of every people. It was written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the royal signet ring. \n   \n","And the letters were sent by couriers to each of the royal provinces with the order to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews—young and old, women and children—and to plunder their possessions on a single day, the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month. \n   \n","A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued in every province and published to all the people, so that they would be ready on that day. \n","The couriers left, spurred on by the king’s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was in confusion. \n"],["When Mordecai learned of all that had happened, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, wailing loudly and bitterly. \n","But he went only as far as the king’s gate, because the law prohibited anyone wearing sackcloth from entering that gate. \n   \n","In every province to which the king’s command and edict came, there was great mourning among the Jews. They fasted, wept, and lamented, and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. \n   \n","When Esther’s maidens and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, the queen was overcome with distress. She sent clothes for Mordecai to wear instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. \n   \n","Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs appointed to her, and she dispatched him to Mordecai to learn what was troubling him and why. \n","So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the king’s gate, \n","and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury in order to destroy the Jews. \n   \n","Mordecai also gave Hathach a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for the destruction of the Jews, to show and explain to Esther, urging her to approach the king, implore his favor, and plead before him for her people. \n   \n","So Hathach went back and relayed Mordecai’s response to Esther. \n   \n","Then Esther spoke to Hathach and instructed him to tell Mordecai, \n","“All the royal officials and the people of the king’s provinces know that one law applies to every man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned—that he be put to death. Only if the king extends the gold scepter may that person live. But I have not been summoned to appear before the king for the past thirty days.” \n   \n","When Esther’s words were relayed to Mordecai, \n","he sent back to her this reply: “Do not imagine that because you are in the king’s palace you alone will escape the fate of all the Jews. \n","For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows if perhaps you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” \n   \n","Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: \n","“Go and assemble all the Jews who can be found in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day, and I and my maidens will fast as you do. After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish! ” \n   \n","So Mordecai went and did all that Esther had instructed him. \n"],["On the third day, Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the palace across from the king’s quarters. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal courtroom, facing the entrance. \n   \n","As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she found favor in his sight. The king extended the gold scepter in his hand toward Esther, and she approached and touched the tip of the scepter. \n   \n","“What is it, Queen Esther?” the king inquired. “What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given to you.” \n   \n","“If it pleases the king,” Esther replied, “may the king and Haman come today to the banquet I have prepared for the king.” \n   \n","“Hurry,” commanded the king, “and bring Haman, so we can do as Esther has requested.” \n  So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared. \n","And as they drank their wine, the king said to Esther, “What is your petition? It will be given to you. What is your request?

At the king’s gate, however, he saw Mordecai, who did not rise or tremble in fear at his presence. And Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai. \n   \n","Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home. And calling for his friends and his wife Zeresh, \n","Haman recounted to them his glorious wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored and promoted him over the other officials and servants. \n   \n","“What is more,” Haman added, “Queen Esther invited no one but me to join the king at the banquet she prepared, and I am invited back tomorrow along with the king. \n","Yet none of this satisfies me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.” \n   \n","His wife Zeresh and all his friends told him, “Have them build a gallows fifty cubits high, and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go to the banquet with the king and enjoy yourself.” \n  The advice pleased Haman, and he had the gallows constructed. \n"],["That night sleep escaped the king; so he ordered the Book of Records, the Chronicles, to be brought in and read to him. \n","And there it was found recorded that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana  and Teresh, two of the eunuchs who guarded the king’s entrance, when they had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes. \n   \n","The king inquired, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this act?” \n  “Nothing has been done for him,” replied the king’s attendants. \n   \n","“Who is in the court?” the king asked. \n  Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared for him. \n","So the king’s attendants answered him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.” \n  “Bring him in,” ordered the king. \n   \n","Haman entered, and the king asked him, “What should be done for the man whom the king is delighted to honor?” \n  Now Haman thought to himself, “Whom would the king be delighted to honor more than me?” \n   \n","And Haman told the king, “For the man whom the king is delighted to honor, \n","have them bring a royal robe that the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself has ridden—one with a royal crest placed on its head. \n","Let the robe and the horse be entrusted to one of the king’s most noble princes. Let them array the man the king wants to honor and parade him on the horse through the city square, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king is delighted to honor!’” \n   \n","“Hurry,” said the king to Haman, “and do just as you proposed.

They killed 75,000 who hated them, but they did not lay a hand on the plunder. \n","This was done on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested, making it a day of feasting and joy. \n   \n","The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth days of the month. So they rested on the fifteenth day, making it a day of feasting and joy. \n","This is why the rural Jews, who live in the villages, observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting. It is a holiday for sending gifts to one another. \n   \n","Mordecai recorded these events and sent letters to all the Jews in all the provinces of King Xerxes, both near and far, \n","to establish among them an annual celebration on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar \n","as the days on which the Jews gained rest from their enemies and the month in which their sorrow turned to joy and their mourning into a holiday.

So should I be consulted by you, O house of Israel? As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will not be consulted by you! \n   \n","When you say, ‘Let us be like the nations, like the peoples of the lands, serving wood and stone,’ what you have in mind will never come to pass. \n   \n","As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, with a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath I will rule over you. \n","With a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you  from the lands to which you have been scattered. \n","And I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations, where I will enter into judgment with you face to face. \n   \n","Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, declares the Lord GOD. \n","I will make you pass under the rod and will bring you into the bond of the covenant. \n","And I will purge you of those who rebel and transgress against Me. I will bring them out of the land in which they dwell, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD. \n   \n","And as for you, O house of Israel, this is what the Lord GOD says: Go and serve your idols, every one of you. But afterward, you will surely listen to Me, and you will no longer defile My holy name with your gifts and idols. \n   \n","For on My holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, there the whole house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the land. There I will accept them and will require your offerings and choice gifts, along with all your holy sacrifices. \n   \n","When I bring you from the peoples and gather you from the lands to which you have been scattered, I will accept you as a pleasing aroma.

Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them. \n   \n","There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured the distance from gateway to gateway to be a hundred cubits. \n   \n","Then he led me to the south side, and I saw a gateway facing south. He measured its side pillars and portico, and they had the same measurements as the others. \n","Both the gateway and its portico had windows all around, like the other windows. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. \n","Seven steps led up to it, and its portico was opposite them; it had palm trees on its side pillars, one on each side. \n   \n","The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured the distance from gateway to gateway toward the south to be a hundred cubits. \n   \n","Next he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others. \n","Its gate chambers, side pillars, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both the gateway and its portico had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. \n","(The porticoes around the inner court were twenty-five cubits long and five cubits deep. ) \n","Its portico faced the outer court, and its side pillars were decorated with palm trees. Eight steps led up to it. \n   \n","And he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others. \n","Its gate chambers, side pillars, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both the gateway and its portico had windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. \n","Its portico faced the outer court, and its side pillars were decorated with palm trees on each side. Eight steps led up to it. \n   \n","Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same measurements as the others, \n","as did its gate chambers, side pillars, and portico. It also had windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. \n","Its portico  faced the outer court, and its side pillars were decorated with palm trees on each side. Eight steps led up to it. \n   \n","There was a chamber with a doorway by the portico  in each of the inner gateways. There the burnt offering was to be washed. \n","Inside the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings were to be slaughtered. \n   \n","Outside, as one goes up to the entrance of the north gateway, there were two tables on one side and two more tables on the other side of the gate’s portico. \n","So there were four tables inside the gateway and four outside—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered. \n   \n","There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offering, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit high. On these were placed the utensils used to slaughter the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices. \n   \n","The double-pronged hooks,  each a handbreadth long, were fastened all around the inside of the room, and the flesh of the offering was to be placed on the tables. \n   \n","Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two chambers,  one beside the north gate and facing south, and another beside the south gate  and facing north. \n   \n","Then the man said to me: “The chamber that faces south is for the priests who keep charge of the temple, \n","and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, the only Levites who may approach the LORD to minister before Him.” \n   \n","Next he measured the court. It was square, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple. \n   \n","Then he brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the side pillars of the portico to be five cubits on each side. The width of the gateway was fourteen cubits and its sidewalls were three cubits on either side. \n","The portico was twenty cubits wide   and twelve cubits deep,  and ten steps led up to it. There were columns by the side pillars, one on each side. \n"],["Then the man brought me into the outer sanctuary and measured the side pillars to be six cubits wide   on each side. \n","The width of the entrance was ten cubits,  and the sides of the entrance were five cubits   on each side. He also measured the length of the outer sanctuary to be forty cubits, and the width to be twenty cubits. \n   \n","And he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the side pillars at the entrance to be two cubits wide.  The entrance was six cubits wide, and the walls on each side were seven cubits wide. \n","Then he measured the room adjacent to the inner sanctuary   to be twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide.  And he said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place. ” \n   \n","Next he measured the wall of the temple to be six cubits thick, and the width of each side room around the temple was four cubits. \n","The side rooms were arranged one above another in three levels of thirty rooms each. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports would not be fastened into the wall of the temple itself. \n","The side rooms surrounding the temple widened at each successive level, because the structure surrounding the temple ascended by stages corresponding to the narrowing of the temple wall as it rose upward. And so a stairway went up from the lowest story to the highest, through the middle one. \n   \n","I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the full length of a rod, six long cubits. \n","The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick, and the open area between the side rooms of the temple \n","and the outer chambers was twenty cubits wide all around the temple. \n","The side rooms opened into this area, with one entrance on the north and another on the south. The open area was five cubits wide all around. \n   \n","Now the building that faced the temple courtyard on the west was seventy cubits wide,  and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, with a length of ninety cubits. \n   \n","Then he measured the temple to be a hundred cubits long, and the temple courtyard and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long. \n","The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a hundred cubits. \n   \n","Next he measured the length of the building facing the temple courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits. The outer sanctuary, the inner sanctuary, and the porticoes facing the court, \n","as well as the thresholds and the beveled windows and the galleries all around with their three levels opposite the threshold, were overlaid with wood on all sides. They were paneled from the ground to the windows, and the windows were covered. \n   \n","In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary on all the walls, spaced evenly around the inner and outer sanctuary, \n","were alternating carved cherubim and palm trees. Each cherub had two faces: \n","the face of a man was toward the palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion was toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved all the way around the temple. \n","Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the outer sanctuary from the floor to the space above the entrance. \n   \n","The outer sanctuary had a rectangular doorframe, and the doorframe of the sanctuary was similar. \n   \n","There was an altar of wood three cubits high and two cubits square. Its corners, base, and sides were of wood. And the man told me, “This is the table that is before the LORD.” \n   \n","Both the outer sanctuary and the inner sanctuary had double doors, \n","and each door had two swinging panels. There were two panels for one door and two for the other. \n","Cherubim and palm trees like those on the walls were carved on the doors of the outer sanctuary, and there was a wooden canopy outside, on the front of the portico. \n","There were beveled windows and palm trees on the sidewalls of the portico. The side rooms of the temple also had canopies. \n"],["Then the man led me out northward into the outer court, and he brought me to the group of chambers opposite the temple courtyard and the outer wall on the north side. \n","The building with the door facing north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide. \n","Gallery faced gallery in three levels opposite the twenty cubits  that belonged to the inner court and opposite the pavement that belonged to the outer court. \n   \n","In front of the chambers was an inner walkway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long. Their doors were on the north. \n   \n","Now the upper chambers were smaller because the galleries took more space from the chambers on the lower and middle floors of the building. \n","For they were arranged in three stories, and unlike the courts, they had no pillars. So the upper chambers were set back further than the lower and middle floors. \n","An outer wall in front of the chambers was fifty cubits long and ran parallel to the chambers and the outer court. \n","For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those facing the temple were a hundred cubits long. \n","And below these chambers was the entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court. \n   \n","On the south side  along the length of the wall of the outer court were chambers adjoining the courtyard and opposite the building, \n","with a passageway in front of them, just like the chambers that were on the north. They had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions. \n","And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that were facing south, there was a door in front of the walkway that was parallel to the wall extending eastward. \n   \n","Then the man said to me, “The north and south chambers facing the temple courtyard are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings. There they will place the most holy offerings—the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings—for the place is holy. \n","Once the priests have entered the holy area, they must not go out into the outer court until they have left behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they approach the places that are for the people.” \n   \n","Now when the man had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate that faced east, and he measured the area all around: \n   \n","With a measuring rod he measured the east side to be five hundred cubits long. \n   \n","He measured the north side to be five hundred cubits long. \n   \n","He measured the south side to be five hundred cubits long. \n   \n","And he came around and measured the west side to be five hundred cubits long. \n   \n","So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall all around, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common. \n"],["Then the man brought me back to the gate that faces east, \n","and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of many waters, and the earth shone with His glory. \n   \n","The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when He came  to destroy the city and like the visions I had seen by the River Kebar. I fell facedown, \n","and the glory of the LORD entered the temple through the gate facing east. \n","Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple. \n   \n","While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple, \n","and He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place for the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel will never again defile My holy name—neither they nor their kings—by their prostitution and by the funeral offerings   for their kings at their deaths. \n","When they placed their threshold next to My threshold and their doorposts beside My doorposts, with only a wall between Me and them, they defiled My holy name by the abominations they committed. Therefore I have consumed them in My anger. \n","Now let them remove far from Me their prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings, and I will dwell among them forever. \n   \n","As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, so that they may be ashamed of their iniquities. Let them measure the plan, \n","and if they are ashamed  of all they have done, then make known to them the design of the temple—its arrangement and its exits and entrances—its whole design along with all its statutes, forms, and laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may keep its complete design and all its statutes and may carry them out. \n   \n","This is the law of the temple: All its surrounding territory on top of the mountain will be most holy. Yes, this is the law of the temple. \n   \n","These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits   (a cubit and a handbreadth): Its gutter shall be a cubit deep and a cubit wide, with a rim of one span  around its edge. \n  And this is the height of the altar: \n","The space from the gutter on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the ledge one cubit wide.  The space from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge shall be four cubits, and the ledge one cubit wide. \n   \n","The altar hearth shall be four cubits high, and four horns shall project upward from the hearth. \n","The altar hearth shall be square at its four corners, twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide. \n","The ledge shall also be square, fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide,  with a rim of half a cubit  and a gutter of a cubit all around it. The steps of the altar shall face east.” \n   \n","Then He said to me: “Son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘These are the statutes for the altar on the day it is constructed, so that burnt offerings may be sacrificed on it and blood may be sprinkled on it: \n","You are to give a young bull from the herd as a sin offering to the Levitical priests who are of the family of Zadok, who approach Me to minister before Me, declares the Lord GOD. \n","You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and all around the rim; thus you will cleanse the altar and make atonement for it. \n","Then you are to take away the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the appointed part of the temple area outside the sanctuary. \n   \n","On the second day you are to present an unblemished male goat as a sin offering, and the altar is to be cleansed as it was with the bull. \n","When you have finished the purification, you are to present a young, unblemished bull and an unblemished ram from the flock. \n","You must present them before the LORD; the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the LORD. \n   \n","For seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering; you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both unblemished. \n","For seven days the priests are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; so they shall consecrate it. \n","At the end of these days, from the eighth day on, the priests are to present your burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, declares the Lord GOD.’” \n"],["The man then brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary that faced east, but it was shut. \n","And the LORD said to me, “This gate is to remain shut. It shall not be opened, and no man shall enter through it, because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it. Therefore it will remain shut. \n","Only the prince himself may sit inside the gateway to eat in the presence of the LORD. He must enter by way of the portico of the gateway and go out the same way.” \n   \n","Then the man brought me to the front of the temple by way of the north gate. I looked and saw the glory of the LORD filling His temple, and I fell facedown. \n","The LORD said to me: “Son of man, pay attention; look carefully with your eyes and listen closely with your ears to everything I tell you concerning all the statutes and laws of the house of the LORD. Take careful note of the entrance to the temple, along with all the exits of the sanctuary. \n   \n","Tell the rebellious house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I have had enough of all your abominations, O house of Israel. \n","In addition to all your other abominations, you brought in foreigners uncircumcised in both heart and flesh to occupy My sanctuary; you defiled My temple when you offered My food—the fat and the blood; you broke My covenant. \n","And you have not kept charge of My holy things, but have appointed others to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.’ \n   \n","This is what the Lord GOD says: No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and flesh may enter My sanctuary—not even a foreigner who lives among the Israelites. \n   \n","Surely the Levites who wandered away from Me when Israel went astray, and who wandered away from Me after their idols, will bear the consequences of their iniquity. \n","Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, having charge of the gates of the temple and ministering there. They shall slaughter the burnt offerings and other sacrifices for the people and stand before them to minister to them. \n   \n","Because they ministered before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I swore with an uplifted hand concerning them that they would bear the consequences of their iniquity, declares the Lord GOD. \n","They must not approach Me to serve Me as priests or come near any of My holy things or the most holy things. They will bear the shame of the abominations they have committed. \n","Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of all the work for the temple and everything to be done in it. \n   \n","But the Levitical priests, who are descended from Zadok and who kept charge of My sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from Me, are to approach Me to minister before Me. They will stand before Me to offer Me fat and blood, declares the Lord GOD. \n","They alone shall enter My sanctuary and draw near to My table to minister before Me. They will keep My charge. \n   \n","When they enter the gates of the inner court, they are to wear linen garments; they must not wear anything made of wool when they minister at the gates of the inner court or inside the temple. \n","They are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists. They must not wear anything that makes them perspire. \n   \n","When they go out to the outer court, to the people, they are to take off the garments in which they have ministered, leave them in the holy chambers, and dress in other clothes so that they do not transmit holiness to the people with their garments. \n   \n","They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long, but must carefully trim their hair. \n","No priest may drink wine before he enters the inner court. \n","And they shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman, but must marry a virgin of the descendants of the house of Israel, or a widow of a priest. \n","They are to teach My people the difference between the holy and the common, and show them how to discern between the clean and the unclean. \n   \n","In any dispute, they shall officiate as judges and judge according to My ordinances. They must keep My laws and statutes regarding all My appointed feasts, and they must keep My Sabbaths holy. \n   \n","A priest must not defile himself by going near a dead person. However, for a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, or an unmarried sister, he may do so, \n","and after he is cleansed, he must count off seven days for himself. \n","And on the day he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he must present his sin offering, declares the Lord GOD. \n   \n","In regard to their inheritance, I am their inheritance. You are to give them no possession in Israel, for I am their possession. \n   \n","They shall eat the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings. Everything in Israel devoted to the LORD will belong to them. \n","The best of all the firstfruits and of every contribution from all your offerings will belong to the priests. You are to give your first batch of dough to the priest, so that a blessing may rest upon your homes. \n","The priests may not eat any bird or animal found dead or torn by wild beasts. \n"],["“When you divide the land by lot as an inheritance, you are to set aside a portion for the LORD, a holy portion of the land 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide. This entire tract of land will be holy. \n   \n","Within this area there is to be a section for the sanctuary 500 cubits square,  with 50 cubits  around it for open land. \n   \n","From this holy portion, you are to measure off a length of 25,000 cubits and a width of 10,000 cubits,  and in it will be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. \n","It will be a holy portion of the land to be used by the priests who minister in the sanctuary, who draw near to minister before the LORD. It will be a place for their houses, as well as a holy area for the sanctuary. \n   \n","An adjacent area 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide shall belong to the Levites who minister in the temple; it will be their possession for towns in which to live. \n   \n","As the property of the city, you are to set aside an area 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, adjacent to the holy district. It will belong to the whole house of Israel. \n   \n","Now the prince will have the area bordering each side of the area formed by the holy district and the property of the city, extending westward from the western side and eastward from the eastern side, running lengthwise from the western boundary to the eastern boundary and parallel to one of the tribal portions. \n","This land will be his possession in Israel. \n  And My princes will no longer oppress My people, but will give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes. \n","For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Enough, O princes of Israel! Cease your violence and oppression, and do what is just and right. Stop dispossessing My people, declares the Lord GOD.’ \n   \n","You must use honest scales, a just ephah,  and a just bath. \n   \n","The ephah and the bath shall be the same quantity so that the bath will contain a tenth of a homer, and the ephah a tenth of a homer; the homer will be the standard measure for both. \n   \n","The shekel will consist of twenty gerahs.  Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels will equal one mina. \n   \n","This is the contribution you are to offer: a sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat, and a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley. \n","The prescribed portion of oil, measured by the bath, is a tenth of a bath from each cor  (a cor consists of ten baths or one homer, since ten baths are equivalent to a homer). \n","And one sheep shall be given from each flock of two hundred from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These are for the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for the people, declares the Lord GOD. \n   \n","All the people of the land must participate in this contribution for the prince in Israel. \n","And it shall be the prince’s part to provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings for the feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths—for all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He will provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel. \n   \n","This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘On the first day of the first month you are to take a young bull without blemish and purify the sanctuary. \n","And the priest is to take some of the blood from the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the inner court. \n","You must do the same thing on the seventh day of the month for anyone who strays unintentionally or in ignorance. In this way you will make atonement for the temple. \n   \n","On the fourteenth day of the first month you are to observe the Passover, a feast of seven days, during which unleavened bread shall be eaten. \n","On that day the prince shall provide a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land. \n","Each day during the seven days of the feast, he shall provide seven bulls and seven rams without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD, along with a male goat for a sin offering. \n","He shall also provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull and an ephah for each ram, along with a hin of olive oil for each ephah of grain. \n","During the seven days of the feast that begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he is to make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, and oil.’ \n"],["“This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘The gate of the inner court that faces east must be kept shut during the six days of work, but on the Sabbath day and on the day of the New Moon it shall be opened. \n","The prince is to enter from the outside through the portico of the gateway and stand by the gatepost, while the priests sacrifice his burnt offerings and peace offerings. He is to bow in worship at the threshold of the gate and then depart, but the gate must not be shut until evening. \n","On the Sabbaths and New Moons the people of the land are also to bow in worship before the LORD at the entrance to that gateway. \n   \n","The burnt offering that the prince presents to the LORD on the Sabbath day shall be six unblemished male lambs and an unblemished ram. \n","The grain offering with the ram shall be one ephah, and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able, along with a hin of oil per ephah. \n","On the day of the New Moon he shall offer a young, unblemished bull, six lambs, and a ram without blemish. \n","He is to provide a grain offering of an ephah with the bull, an ephah with the ram, and as much as he is able with the lambs, along with a hin of oil per ephah. \n","When the prince enters, he shall go in through the portico of the gateway, and he shall go out the same way. \n   \n","When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, whoever enters by the north gate to worship must go out by the south gate, and whoever enters by the south gate must go out by the north gate. No one is to return through the gate by which he entered, but each must go out by the opposite gate. \n   \n","When the people enter, the prince shall go in with them, and when they leave, he shall leave. \n","At the festivals and appointed feasts, the grain offering shall be an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram, and as much as one is able to give with the lambs, along with a hin of oil per ephah. \n   \n","When the prince makes a freewill offering to the LORD, whether a burnt offering or a peace offering, the gate facing east must be opened for him. He is to offer his burnt offering or peace offering just as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and the gate must be closed after he goes out. \n   \n","And you shall provide an unblemished year-old lamb as a daily burnt offering to the LORD; you are to offer it every morning. \n","You are also to provide with it every morning a grain offering of a sixth of an ephah   with a third of a hin of oil  to moisten the fine flour—a grain offering to the LORD. This is a permanent statute. \n","Thus they shall provide the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil every morning as a regular burnt offering.’ \n   \n","This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons as an inheritance, it will belong to his descendants. It will become their property by inheritance. \n","But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will belong to that servant until the year of freedom; then it will revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs only to his sons; it shall be theirs. \n   \n","The prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people by evicting them from their property. He is to provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property, so that none of My people will be displaced from his property.’” \n   \n","Then the man brought me through the entrance at the side of the gate into the holy chambers facing north, which belonged to the priests, and he showed me a place there at the far western end \n","and said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them into the outer court and transmit holiness to the people.” \n   \n","Then he brought me into the outer court and led me around to its four corners, and I saw a separate court in each of its corners. \n","In the four corners of the outer court there were enclosed courts, each forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. Each of the four corner areas had the same dimensions. \n","Around the inside of each of the four courts was a row of masonry with ovens built at the base of the walls on all sides. \n   \n","And he said to me, “These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple will cook the sacrifices offered by the people.” \n"],["Then the man brought me back to the entrance of the temple, and I saw water flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar. \n   \n","Next he brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and there I saw the water trickling out from the south side. \n   \n","As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits  and led me through ankle-deep water. \n   \n","Then he measured off a thousand cubits and led me through knee-deep water. \n  Again he measured a thousand cubits and led me through waist-deep water. \n   \n","Once again he measured off a thousand cubits, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough for swimming—a river that could not be crossed on foot. \n   \n","“Son of man, do you see this?” he asked. Then he led me back to the bank of the river. \n   \n","When I arrived, I saw a great number of trees along both banks of the river. \n","And he said to me, “This water flows out to the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah. When it empties into the Sea,  the water there becomes fresh. \n","Wherever the river flows, there will be swarms of living creatures and a great number of fish, because it flows there and makes the waters fresh; so wherever the river flows, everything will flourish. \n   \n","Fishermen will stand by the shore; from En-gedi to En-eglaim they will spread their nets to catch fish of many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea. \n   \n","But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt. \n   \n","Along both banks of the river, fruit trees of all kinds will grow.

He carried these off to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, where he put them in the treasury of his god. \n   \n","Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his court officials, to bring in some Israelites from the royal family  and the nobility—\n","young men without blemish, handsome, gifted in all wisdom, knowledgeable, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king’s palace—and to teach them the language and literature of the Chaldeans. \n   \n","The king assigned them daily provisions of the royal food and wine. They were to be trained for three years, after which they were to enter the king’s service. \n   \n","Among these young men were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. \n","The chief official gave them new names: To Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego. \n   \n","But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king’s food or wine. So he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself. \n   \n","Now God had granted Daniel favor and compassion from the chief official, \n","but he said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. For why should he see your faces looking thinner than those of the other young men your age? You would endanger my head before the king!” \n   \n","Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, \n","“Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given only vegetables to eat and water to drink. \n","Then compare our appearances with those of the young men who are eating the royal food, and deal with your servants according to what you see.” \n   \n","So he consented to this and tested them for ten days. \n","And at the end of ten days, they looked healthier and better nourished than all the young men who were eating the king’s food. \n","So the steward continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink, and he gave them vegetables instead. \n   \n","To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom. And Daniel had insight into all kinds of visions and dreams. \n   \n","Now at the end of the time specified by the king, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. \n","And the king spoke with them, and among all the young men he found no one equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they entered the king’s service. \n   \n","In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom. \n","And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus. \n"],["In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams that troubled his spirit, and sleep escaped him. \n","So the king gave orders to summon the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers  to explain his dreams. When they came and stood before the king, \n","he said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to understand it.” \n   \n","Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, “O king, may you live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.” \n   \n","The king replied to the astrologers, “My word is final: If you do not tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be cut into pieces and your houses will be reduced to rubble. \n","But if you tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and its interpretation.” \n   \n","They answered a second time, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will give the interpretation.” \n   \n","The king replied, “I know for sure that you are stalling for time, because you see that my word is final. \n","If you do not tell me the dream, there is only one decree for you. You have conspired to speak before me false and fraudulent words, hoping the situation will change. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can give me its interpretation.” \n   \n","The astrologers answered the king, “No one on earth can do what the king requests! No king, however great and powerful, has ever asked anything like this of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer. \n","What the king requests is so difficult that no one can tell it to him except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals.” \n   \n","This response made the king so furious with anger that he gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. \n","So the decree went out that the wise men were to be executed, and men went to look for Daniel and his friends to execute them. \n   \n","When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon, Daniel replied with discretion and tact. \n","“Why is the decree from the king so harsh?” he asked. \n  At this time Arioch explained the situation to Daniel. \n","So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him some time, so that he could give him the interpretation. \n   \n","Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, \n","urging them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his friends would not be killed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. \n   \n","During the night, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision, and he blessed the God of heaven \n","and declared: \n  “Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, \n for wisdom and power belong to Him. \n  \n","He changes the times and seasons; \n He removes kings and establishes them. \n He gives wisdom to the wise \n and knowledge to the discerning. \n  \n","He reveals the deep and hidden things; \n He knows what lies in darkness, \n and light dwells with Him. \n  \n","To You, O God of my fathers, \n I give thanks and praise, \n because You have given me \n wisdom and power. \n And now You have made known to me \n what we have requested, \n for You have made known to us \n the dream of the king.” \n   \n","Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon! Bring me before the king, and I will give him the interpretation.” \n   \n","Arioch hastily brought Daniel before the king and said to him, “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who will tell the king the interpretation.” \n   \n","The king responded to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to tell me what I saw in the dream, as well as its interpretation?” \n   \n","Daniel answered the king, “No wise man, enchanter, medium, or magician can explain to the king the mystery of which he inquires. \n","But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the latter days. Your dream and the visions that came into your mind as you lay on your bed were these: \n   \n","As you lay on your bed, O king, your thoughts turned to the future, and the Revealer of Mysteries made known to you what will happen. \n","And to me this mystery has been revealed, not because I have more wisdom than any man alive, but in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind. \n   \n","As you, O king, were watching, a great statue  appeared. A great and dazzling statue stood before you, and its form was awesome. \n","The head of the statue was pure gold, its chest and arms were silver, its belly and thighs were bronze, \n","its legs were iron, and its feet were part iron and part clay. \n   \n","As you watched, a stone was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and crushed them. \n","Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were shattered and became like chaff on the threshing floor in summer. The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that had struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. \n   \n","This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation. \n   \n","You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given sovereignty, power, strength, and glory. \n","Wherever the sons of men or beasts of the field or birds of the air dwell, He has given them into your hand and has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold. \n   \n","But after you, there will arise another kingdom, inferior to yours. \n  Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule the whole earth. \n   \n","Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron; for iron shatters and crushes all things, and like iron that crushes all things, it will shatter and crush all the others. \n","And just as you saw that the feet and toes were made partly of fired clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom, yet some of the strength of iron will be in it—just as you saw the iron mixed with clay. \n","And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. \n","As you saw the iron mixed with clay, so the peoples  will mix with one another, but will not hold together any more than iron mixes with clay. \n   \n","In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will shatter all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, but will itself stand forever. \n","And just as you saw a stone being cut out of the mountain without human hands, and it shattered the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold, so the great God has told the king what will happen in the future. \n  The dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy.” \n   \n","At this, King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, paid homage to Daniel, and ordered that an offering of incense be presented to him. \n","The king said to Daniel, “Your God is truly the God of gods and Lord of kings, the Revealer of Mysteries, since you were able to reveal this mystery.” \n   \n","Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many generous gifts. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon. \n","And at Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to manage the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained in the king’s court. \n"],["King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue   sixty cubits high and six cubits wide, and he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. \n","Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other officials of the provinces to attend the dedication of the statue he had set up. \n   \n","So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it. \n   \n","Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “O people of every nation and language, this is what you are commanded: \n","As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. \n","And whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the blazing fiery furnace.” \n   \n","Therefore, as soon as all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and all kinds of music, the people of every nation and language would fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. \n   \n","At this time some astrologers  came forward and maliciously accused the Jews, \n","saying to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, may you live forever! \n","You, O king, have issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the golden statue, \n","and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into the blazing fiery furnace. \n","But there are some Jews you have appointed to manage the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—who have ignored you, O king, and have refused to serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have set up.” \n   \n","Then Nebuchadnezzar, furious with rage, summoned Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

But if you refuse to worship, you will be thrown at once into the blazing fiery furnace. Then what god will be able to deliver you from my hands?” \n   \n","Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. \n","If the God whom we serve exists, then He is able  to deliver us from the blazing fiery furnace and from your hand, O king. \n","But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have set up.” \n   \n","At this, Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than usual, \n","and he commanded some mighty men of valor in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing fiery furnace. \n   \n","So they were tied up, wearing robes, trousers, turbans, and other clothes, and they were thrown into the blazing fiery furnace. \n   \n","The king’s command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the fiery flames killed the men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. \n","And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, firmly bound, fell into the blazing fiery furnace. \n   \n","Suddenly King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and asked his advisers, “Did we not throw three men, firmly bound, into the fire?” \n  “Certainly, O king,” they replied. \n   \n","“Look!” he exclaimed. “I see four men, unbound and unharmed, walking around in the fire—and the fourth looks like a son of the gods! ” \n   \n","Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the blazing fiery furnace and called out, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out!” \n  So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire, \n","and when the satraps, prefects, governors, and royal advisers had gathered around, they saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men.

And I told him the dream: \n","“O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery baffles you. So explain to me the visions I saw in my dream, and their interpretation. \n","In these visions of my mind as I was lying in bed, I saw this come to pass: \n  There was a tree in the midst of the land, \n and its height was great. \n  \n","The tree grew large and strong; \n its top reached the sky, \n and it was visible \n to the ends of the earth. \n  \n","Its leaves were beautiful, \n its fruit was abundant, \n and upon it was food for all. \n Under it the beasts of the field found shelter, \n in its branches the birds of the air nested, \n and from it every creature was fed. \n   \n","As I lay on my bed, I also saw in the visions of my mind a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven. \n","He called out in a loud voice: \n  ‘Cut down the tree and chop off its branches; \n strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. \n Let the beasts flee from under it, \n and the birds from its branches. \n  \n","But leave the stump with its roots in the ground, \n and a band of iron and bronze around it, \n in the tender grass of the field. \n  Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven \n and graze with the beasts on the grass of the earth. \n  \n","Let his mind be changed from that of a man, \n and let him be given the mind of a beast \n till seven times pass him by. \n  \n","This decision is the decree of the watchers, \n the verdict declared by the holy ones, \n so that the living will know \n that the Most High rules over the kingdom of mankind \n and gives it to whom He wishes, \n setting over it the lowliest of men.’ \n   \n","This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because none of the wise men of my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you are able, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.” \n   \n","For a time, Daniel, who was also known as Belteshazzar, was perplexed, and his thoughts alarmed him. \n  So the king said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.” \n  “My lord,” replied Belteshazzar, “may the dream apply to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies! \n   \n","The tree you saw that grew large and strong, whose top reached the sky and was visible to all the earth, \n","whose foliage was beautiful and whose fruit was abundant, providing food for all, under which the beasts of the field lived, and in whose branches the birds of the air nested—\n","you, O king, are that tree! For you have become great and strong; your greatness has grown to reach the sky, and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth. \n   \n","And you, O king, saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying: \n  ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, \n but leave the stump with its roots in the ground, \n and a band of iron and bronze around it, \n in the tender grass of the field. \n  Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, \n and graze with the beasts of the field \n till seven times pass him by.’ \n   \n","This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree that the Most High has issued against my lord the king: \n   \n","You will be driven away from mankind, and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field. You will feed on grass like an ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass you by, until you acknowledge that the Most High rules over the kingdom of mankind and gives it to whom He wishes. \n   \n","As for the command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots, your kingdom will be restored to you as soon as you acknowledge that Heaven rules. \n","Therefore, may my advice be pleasing to you, O king. Break away from your sins by doing what is right, and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed. Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity.” \n   \n","All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. \n","Twelve months later, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, \n","the king exclaimed, “Is this not Babylon the Great, which I myself have built by the might of my power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?” \n   \n","While the words were still in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven: “It is decreed to you, King Nebuchadnezzar, that the kingdom has departed from you. \n","You will be driven away from mankind to live with the beasts of the field, and you will feed on grass like an ox. And seven times will pass you by, until you acknowledge that the Most High rules over the kingdom of mankind and gives it to whom He wishes.” \n   \n","At that moment the sentence against Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from mankind.

My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne, and surpassing greatness was added to me. \n","Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, for all His works are true and all His ways are just. And He is able to humble those who walk in pride. \n"],["Later,  King Belshazzar held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he drank wine with them. \n","Under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar gave orders to bring in the gold and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar his father  had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king could drink from them, along with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines. \n   \n","Thus they brought in the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king drank from them, along with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines. \n","As they drank the wine, they praised their gods of gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone. \n   \n","At that moment the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. As the king watched the hand that was writing, \n","his face grew pale and his thoughts so alarmed him that his hips gave way and his knees knocked together. \n   \n","The king called out for the enchanters, astrologers, and diviners to be brought in, and he said to these wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this inscription and tells me its interpretation will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.” \n   \n","So all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the inscription or interpret it for him. \n","Then King Belshazzar became even more terrified, his face grew even more pale, and his nobles were bewildered. \n   \n","Hearing the outcry of the king and his nobles, the queen  entered the banquet hall. “O king, may you live forever!” she said. “Do not let your thoughts terrify you, or your face grow pale. \n","There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the days of your father he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like that of the gods. \n  Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners. Your own father, the king, \n","did this because Daniel, the one he named Belteshazzar, was found to have an extraordinary spirit, as well as knowledge, understanding, and the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems. Summon Daniel, therefore, and he will give you the interpretation.” \n   \n","So Daniel was brought before the king, who asked him, “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah? \n","I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that you have insight, intelligence, and extraordinary wisdom. \n   \n","Now the wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this inscription and interpret it for me, but they could not give its interpretation. \n","But I have heard about you, that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems. Therefore, if you can read this inscription and give me its interpretation, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.” \n   \n","In response, Daniel said to the king, “You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the inscription for the king and interpret it for him. \n","As for you, O king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness, glory and honor. \n","Because of the greatness that He bestowed on him, the people of every nation and language trembled in fear before him. He killed whom he wished and kept alive whom he wished; he exalted whom he wished and humbled whom he wished. \n   \n","But when his heart became arrogant and his spirit was hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne, and his glory was taken from him. \n","He was driven away from mankind, and his mind was like that of a beast. He lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he acknowledged that the Most High God rules over the kingdom of mankind, setting over it whom He wishes. \n   \n","But you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this. \n","Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. The vessels from His house were brought to you, and as you drank wine from them with your nobles, wives, and concubines, you praised your gods of silver and gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you have failed to glorify the God who holds in His hand your very breath and all your ways. \n","Therefore He sent the hand that wrote the inscription. \n   \n","Now this is the inscription that was written: \n  MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN. \n   \n","And this is the interpretation of the message: \n  MENE  means that God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. \n   \n","TEKEL  means that you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient. \n   \n","PERES  means that your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians.” \n   \n","Then Belshazzar gave the command, and they clothed Daniel in purple, placed a gold chain around his neck, and proclaimed him the third highest ruler in the kingdom. \n   \n","That very night Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans  was slain, \n","and Darius the Mede received the kingdom at the age of sixty-two. \n"],["Now it pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom, \n","and over them three administrators, including Daniel, to whom these satraps were accountable so that the king would not suffer loss. \n","Soon, by his extraordinary spirit, Daniel distinguished himself among the administrators and satraps. So the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. \n   \n","Thus the administrators and satraps sought a charge against Daniel concerning the kingdom, but they could find no charge or corruption, because he was trustworthy, and no negligence or corruption was found in him. \n","Finally these men said, “We will never find any charge against this Daniel, unless we find something against him concerning the law of his God.” \n   \n","So the administrators and satraps went together to the king and said, “O King Darius, may you live forever! \n","All the royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers, and governors have agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce a decree that for thirty days anyone who petitions any god or man except you, O king, will be thrown into the den of lions. \n","Therefore, O king, establish the decree and sign the document so that it cannot be changed—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.” \n   \n","Therefore King Darius signed the written decree. \n   \n","Now when Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went into his house, where the windows of his upper room opened toward Jerusalem, and three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before. \n","Then these men went as a group and found Daniel petitioning and imploring his God. \n","So they approached the king and asked about his royal decree: “Did you not sign a decree that for thirty days any man who petitions any god or man except you, O king, will be thrown into the den of lions?” \n  The king replied, “According to the law of the Medes and Persians the order stands, and it cannot be repealed.” \n   \n","Then they told the king, “Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, shows no regard for you, O king, or for the decree that you have signed. He still makes his petition three times a day.” \n   \n","As soon as the king heard this, he was deeply distressed and set his mind on delivering Daniel, and he labored until sundown to rescue him. \n   \n","Then the men approached the king together and said to him, “Remember, O king, that by the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or ordinance established by the king can be changed.” \n   \n","So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the den of lions. \n  The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!” \n   \n","A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that nothing concerning Daniel could be changed. \n   \n","Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting. No entertainment was brought before him, and sleep fled from him. \n   \n","At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the den of lions. \n","When he reached the den, he cried out in a voice of anguish, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?” \n   \n","Then Daniel replied, “O king, may you live forever! \n","My God sent His angel and shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, for I was found innocent in His sight, and I have done no wrong against you, O king.” \n   \n","The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den, and when Daniel was lifted out of the den, no wounds whatsoever were found on him, because he had trusted in his God. \n   \n","At the command of the king, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the den of lions—they and their children and wives. And before they had reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones. \n   \n","Then King Darius wrote to the people of every nation and language throughout the land: “May your prosperity abound. \n","I hereby decree that in every part of my kingdom, men are to tremble in fear before the God of Daniel: \n  For He is the living God, \n and He endures forever; \n His kingdom will never be destroyed, \n and His dominion will never end. \n  \n","He delivers and rescues; \n He performs signs and wonders \n in the heavens and on the earth, \n for He has rescued Daniel \n from the power of the lions.” \n   \n","So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus  the Persian. \n"],["In the first year of the reign of Belshazzar over Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he lay on his bed. He wrote down the dream, and this is the summary of his account. \n   \n","Daniel declared: “In my vision in the night I looked, and suddenly the four winds of heaven were churning up the great sea. \n","Then four great beasts came up out of the sea, each one different from the others: \n   \n","The first beast was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and given the mind of a man. \n   \n","Suddenly another beast appeared, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. So it was told, ‘Get up and gorge yourself on flesh!’ \n   \n","Next, as I watched, another beast appeared. It was like a leopard, and on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. \n   \n","After this, as I watched in my vision in the night, suddenly a fourth beast appeared, and it was terrifying—dreadful and extremely strong—with large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed; then it trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the beasts before it, and it had ten horns. \n","While I was contemplating the horns, suddenly another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like those of a man and a mouth that spoke words of arrogance. \n   \n","As I continued to watch, \n  thrones were set in place, \n and the Ancient of Days took His seat. \n His clothing was white as snow, \n and the hair of His head was like pure wool. \n His throne was flaming with fire, \n and its wheels were all ablaze. \n  \n","A river of fire was flowing, \n coming out from His presence. \n Thousands upon thousands attended Him, \n and myriads upon myriads stood before Him. \n The court was convened, \n and the books were opened. \n   \n","Then I kept watching because of the arrogant words the horn was speaking. As I continued to watch, the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. \n","As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was removed, but they were granted an extension of life for a season and a time. \n   \n","In my vision in the night I continued to watch, \n  and I saw One like the Son of Man  \n coming with the clouds of heaven. \n He approached the Ancient of Days \n and was led into His presence. \n  \n","And He was given dominion, \n glory, and kingship, \n that the people of every nation and language \n should serve Him. \n His dominion is an everlasting dominion \n that will not pass away, \n and His kingdom is one \n that will never be destroyed. \n   \n","I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit, and the visions in my mind alarmed me. \n","I approached one of those who were standing there, and I asked him the true meaning of all this. \n  So he told me the interpretation of these things: \n","‘These four great beasts are four kings who will arise from the earth. \n","But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever—yes, forever and ever.’ \n   \n","Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others—extremely terrifying—devouring and crushing with iron teeth and bronze claws, then trampling underfoot whatever was left. \n","I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn whose appearance was more imposing than the others, with eyes and with a mouth that spoke words of arrogance. \n","As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and prevailing against them, \n","until the Ancient of Days arrived and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came for them to possess the kingdom. \n   \n","This is what he said: ‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on the earth, different from all the other kingdoms, and it will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and crush it. \n","And the ten horns are ten kings who will rise from this kingdom. After them another king, different from the earlier ones, will rise and subdue three kings. \n","He will speak out against the Most High and oppress the saints of the Most High, intending to change the appointed times and laws; and the saints will be given into his hand for a time, and times, and half a time. \n   \n","But the court will convene, and his dominion will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. \n","Then the sovereignty, dominion, and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven will be given to the people, the saints of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will serve and obey Him.’ \n   \n","Thus ends the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and my face turned pale. But I kept the matter to myself.” \n"],["In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, subsequent to the one that had appeared to me earlier. \n","And in the vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa, in the province of Elam. I saw in the vision that I was beside the Ulai Canal. \n   \n","Then I lifted up my eyes and saw a ram with two horns standing beside the canal. The horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one grew up later. \n","I saw the ram charging toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against him, and there was no deliverance from his power. He did as he pleased and became great. \n   \n","As I was contemplating all this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came out of the west, crossing the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground. \n","He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and rushed at him with furious power. \n","I saw him approach the ram in a rage against him, and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against him, and the goat threw him to the ground and trampled him, and no one could deliver the ram from his power. \n   \n","Thus the goat became very great, but at the height of his power, his large horn was broken off, and four prominent horns came up in its place, pointing toward the four winds of heaven. \n   \n","From one of these horns a little horn emerged and grew extensively toward the south and the east and toward the Beautiful Land. \n","It grew as high as the host of heaven, and it cast down some of the host and some of the stars to the earth, and trampled them. \n","It magnified itself, even to the Prince of the host; it removed His daily sacrifice and overthrew the place of His sanctuary. \n","And in the rebellion, the host and the daily sacrifice were given over to the horn, and it flung truth to the ground and prospered in whatever it did. \n   \n","Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, “How long until the fulfillment of the vision of the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host to be trampled?” \n   \n","He said to me, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be properly restored.” \n   \n","While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man. \n","And I heard the voice of a man calling from between the banks of the Ulai: “Gabriel, explain the vision to this man.” \n   \n","As he came near to where I stood, I was terrified and fell facedown. \n  “Son of man,” he said to me, “understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.” \n   \n","While he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. \n  Then he touched me, helped me to my feet, \n","and said, “Behold, I will make known to you what will happen in the latter time of wrath, because it concerns the appointed time of the end. \n   \n","The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia. \n","The shaggy goat represents the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes is the first king. \n","The four horns that replaced the broken one represent four kingdoms that will rise from that nation, but will not have the same power. \n   \n","In the latter part of their reign, when the rebellion has reached its full measure, an insolent king, skilled in intrigue, will come to the throne. \n","His power will be great, but it will not be his own. He will cause terrible destruction and succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men along with the holy people. \n","Through his craft and by his hand, he will cause deceit to prosper, and in his own mind he will make himself great. In a time of peace he will destroy many, and he will even stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be broken off, but not by human hands. \n   \n","The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been spoken is true. Now you must seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.” \n   \n","I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business. I was confounded by the vision; it was beyond understanding. \n"],["In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes,  a Mede by descent, who was made ruler over the kingdom of the Chaldeans  —\n","in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the sacred books, according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years. \n","So I turned my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and petition, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes. \n   \n","And I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed, “O, Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant of loving devotion  to those who love Him and keep His commandments, \n","we have sinned and done wrong. We have acted wickedly and rebelled. We have turned away from Your commandments and ordinances. \n","We have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, leaders, and fathers, and to all the people of the land. \n   \n","To You, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but this day we are covered with shame—the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, and all Israel near and far, in all the countries to which You have driven us because of our unfaithfulness to You. \n","O LORD, we are covered with shame—our kings, our leaders, and our fathers—because we have sinned against You. \n   \n","To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, even though we have rebelled against Him \n","and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God to walk in His laws, which He set before us through His servants the prophets. \n   \n","All Israel has transgressed Your law and turned away, refusing to obey Your voice; so the oath and the curse written in the Law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on us, because we have sinned against You. \n","You have carried out the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing upon us a great disaster. For under all of heaven, nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem. \n   \n","Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us, yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our iniquities and giving attention to Your truth. \n","Therefore the LORD has kept the calamity in store and brought it upon us. For the LORD our God is righteous in all He does; yet we have not obeyed His voice. \n   \n","Now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and who made for Yourself a name renowned to this day, we have sinned; we have acted wickedly. \n","O Lord, in keeping with all Your righteous acts, I pray that Your anger and wrath may turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people are a reproach to all around us. \n   \n","So now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of Your servant. For Your sake, O Lord, cause Your face to shine upon Your desolate sanctuary. \n","Incline Your ear, O my God, and hear; open Your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears Your name. For we are not presenting our petitions before You because of our righteous acts, but because of Your great compassion. \n   \n","O Lord, listen! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, hear and act! For Your sake, O my God, do not delay, because Your city and Your people bear Your name.” \n   \n","While I was speaking, praying, confessing my sin and that of my people Israel, and presenting my petition before the LORD my God concerning His holy mountain—\n","while I was still praying, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice. \n","He instructed me and spoke with me, saying: “O Daniel, I have come now to give you insight and understanding. \n","At the beginning of your petitions, an answer went out, and I have come to tell you, for you are highly precious. So consider the message and understand the vision: \n   \n","Seventy weeks   are decreed for your people and your holy city to stop their transgression, to put an end to sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy Place. \n   \n","Know and understand this: From the issuance of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem, until the Messiah, the Prince, there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of distress. \n   \n","Then after the sixty-two weeks  the Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing. \n  Then the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood, and until the end there will be war; desolations have been decreed. \n","And he will confirm a covenant with many for one week,  but in the middle of the week he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of the temple will come the abomination that causes desolation,  until the decreed destruction is poured out upon him. ” \n"],["In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar. The message was true, and it concerned a great conflict. And the understanding of the message was given to him in a vision. \n   \n","In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three full weeks. \n","I ate no rich food, no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I did not anoint myself with oil until the three weeks were completed. \n   \n","On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris, \n","I lifted up my eyes, and behold, there was a certain man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. \n","His body was like beryl, his face like the brilliance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of polished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude. \n   \n","Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men with me did not see it, but a great terror fell upon them, and they ran and hid themselves. \n   \n","So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision. No strength remained in me; my face grew deathly pale, and I was powerless. \n","I heard the sound of his words, and as I listened, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. \n   \n","Suddenly, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. \n","He said to me, “Daniel, you are a man who is highly precious. Consider carefully the words that I am about to say to you. Stand up, for I have now been sent to you.” \n  And when he had said this to me, I stood up trembling. \n   \n","“Do not be afraid, Daniel,” he said, “for from the first day that you purposed to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them. \n","However, the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia. \n","Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision concerns those days.” \n   \n","While he was speaking these words to me, I set my face toward the ground and became speechless. \n","And suddenly one with the likeness of a man  touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and said to the one standing before me, “My lord, because of the vision, I am overcome with anguish, and I have no strength. \n","How can I, your servant, speak with you, my lord? Now I have no strength, nor is any breath left in me.” \n   \n","Again the one with the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened me. \n","“Do not be afraid, you who are highly precious,” he said. “Peace be with you! Be strong now; be very strong!” \n  As he spoke with me, I was strengthened and said, “Speak, my lord, for you have strengthened me.” \n   \n","“Do you know why I have come to you?” he said. “I must return at once to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I have gone forth, behold, the prince of Greece  will come. \n","But first I will tell you what is inscribed in the Book of Truth.

Then they opened their treasures and presented Him with gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh. \n   \n","And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another route. \n   \n","When the Magi had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up!” he said. “Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the Child to kill Him.” \n   \n","So he got up, took the Child and His mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt, \n","where he stayed until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called My Son.” \n   \n","When Herod saw that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was filled with rage. Sending orders, he put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the Magi. \n","Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: \n   \n","“A voice is heard in Ramah, \n weeping and great mourning, \n Rachel weeping for her children, \n and refusing to be comforted, \n because they are no more.” \n   \n","After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt. \n","“Get up!” he said. “Take the Child and His mother and go to the land of Israel, for those seeking the Child’s life are now dead.” \n   \n","So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and went to the land of Israel. \n","But when he learned that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there.

His food was locusts and wild honey. \n","People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region around the Jordan. \n","Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. \n   \n","But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his place of baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? \n","Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance. \n","And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. \n","The axe lies ready at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. \n   \n","I baptize you with water   for repentance, but after me will come One more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. \n","His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and to gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” \n   \n","At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. \n","But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?” \n   \n","“Let it be so now,” Jesus replied. “It is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness in this way.” Then John permitted Him. \n   \n","As soon as Jesus was baptized, He went up out of the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened,  and He saw  the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting on Him. \n","And a voice from heaven said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased!” \n"],["Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. \n","After fasting forty days and forty nights, He was hungry. \n   \n","The tempter came to Him and said, “If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” \n   \n","But Jesus answered, “It is written: \n  ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, \n but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’ ” \n   \n","Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple. \n","“If You are the Son of God,” he said, “throw Yourself down. For it is written: \n  ‘He will command His angels concerning You, \n and they will lift You up in their hands, \n so that You will not strike Your foot \n against a stone.’ ” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’ ” \n   \n","Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. \n","“All this I will give You,” he said, “if You will fall down and worship me.” \n   \n","“Away from Me, Satan!” Jesus declared. “For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’ ” \n   \n","Then the devil left Him, and angels came and ministered to Him. \n   \n","When Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, He withdrew to Galilee. \n","Leaving Nazareth, He went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, \n","to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: \n   \n","“Land of Zebulun \n and land of Naphtali, \n the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, \n Galilee of the Gentiles—\n  \n","the people living in darkness \n have seen a great light; \n on those living in the land of the shadow of death, \n a light has dawned.” \n   \n","From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” \n   \n","As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. \n","“Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.” \n","And at once they left their nets and followed Him. \n   \n","Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them, \n","and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him. \n   \n","Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. \n","News about Him spread all over Syria, and people brought to Him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering acute pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed—and He healed them. \n   \n","The large crowds that followed Him came from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan. \n"],["When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain and sat down.

But if the salt loses its savor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. \n   \n","You are the light of the world. A city on a hill  cannot be hidden. \n","Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead, they set it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. \n","In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. \n   \n","Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. \n","For I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. \n   \n","So then, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do likewise will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. \n","For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \n   \n","You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not murder’ and ‘Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ \n","But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother   will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca,’  will be subject to the Sanhedrin.  But anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to the fire of hell. \n   \n","So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, \n","leave your gift there before the altar.

It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. \n","And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to depart into hell. \n   \n","It has also been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’ \n","But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, brings adultery upon her. And he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. \n   \n","Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill your vows to the Lord.’ \n","But I tell you not to swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God’s throne; \n","or by the earth, for it is His footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. \n","Nor should you swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. \n","Simply let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ Anything more comes from the evil one. \n   \n","You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’ \n","But I tell you not to resist an evil person.

When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.” \n   \n","On seeing this, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!” \n   \n","But Jesus knew  what they were thinking and said, “Why do you harbor evil in your hearts? \n","Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’ \n","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...” Then He said to the paralytic, “Get up, pick up your mat, and go home.” \n","And the man got up and went home. \n   \n","When the crowds saw this, they were filled with awe and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. \n   \n","As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth. “Follow Me,” He told him, and Matthew got up and followed Him. \n   \n","Later, as Jesus was dining at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Him and His disciples. \n","When the Pharisees saw this, they asked His disciples, “Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” \n   \n","On hearing this, Jesus said, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. \n","But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’  For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners. ” \n   \n","At that time John’s disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast so often, but Your disciples do not fast?” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while He is with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. \n   \n","No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. For the patch will pull away from the garment, and a worse tear will result. \n   \n","Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.” \n   \n","While Jesus was saying these things, a synagogue leader came and knelt before Him. “My daughter has just died,” he said. “But come and place Your hand on her, and she will live.” \n   \n","So Jesus got up and went with him, along with His disciples. \n","Suddenly a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak. \n","She said to herself, “If only I touch His cloak, I will be healed.” \n   \n","Jesus turned and saw her. “Take courage, daughter,” He said, “your faith has healed you.” And the woman was cured from that very hour. \n   \n","When Jesus entered the house of the synagogue leader, He saw the flute players and the noisy crowd. \n","“Go away,” He told them. “The girl is not dead, but asleep.” And they laughed at Him. \n   \n","After the crowd had been put outside, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. \n","And the news about this spread throughout that region. \n   \n","As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” \n   \n","After Jesus had entered the house, the blind men came to Him. “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” He asked. \n  “Yes, Lord,” they answered. \n   \n","Then He touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith will it be done to you.” \n","And their eyes were opened. Jesus warned them sternly, “See that no one finds out about this!” \n","But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout the land. \n   \n","As they were leaving, a demon-possessed man who was mute was brought to Jesus. \n","And when the demon had been driven out, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!” \n   \n","But the Pharisees said, “It is by the prince of demons that He drives out demons.” \n   \n","Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness. \n","When He saw the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. \n   \n","Then He said to His disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. \n","Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest.” \n"],["And calling His twelve disciples to Him, Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and sickness. \n   \n","These are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; \n","Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; \n","Simon the Zealot,  and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus. \n   \n","These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go onto the road of the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. \n","Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. \n","As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.’ \n","Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out demons.

In that hour you will be given what to say. \n","For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. \n   \n","Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise against their parents and have them put to death. \n","You will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved. \n   \n","When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. Truly I tell you, you will not reach all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. \n   \n","A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. \n","It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and a servant like his master.

It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow. \n","But when the sun rose, the seedlings were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. \n   \n","Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings. \n   \n","Still other seed fell on good soil and produced a crop—a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold. \n   \n","He who has ears, let him hear.” \n   \n","Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do You speak to the people in parables?” \n   \n","He replied, “The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. \n","Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. \n","This is why I speak to them in parables: \n  ‘Though seeing, they do not see; \n though hearing, they do not hear or understand.’ \n   \n","In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled: \n  ‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding; \n you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. \n  \n","For this people’s heart has grown callous; \n they hardly hear with their ears, \n and they have closed their eyes. \n Otherwise they might see with their eyes, \n hear with their ears, \n understand with their hearts, \n and turn, and I would heal them.’ \n   \n","But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. \n","For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. \n   \n","Consider, then, the parable of the sower: \n","When anyone hears the message of the kingdom but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown  along the path. \n   \n","The seed sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. \n","But since he has no root, he remains for only a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away. \n   \n","The seed sown among the thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. \n   \n","But the seed sown on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and produces a crop—a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.” \n   \n","Jesus put before them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. \n","But while everyone was asleep, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and slipped away. \n","When the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds also appeared. \n   \n","The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’ \n   \n","‘An enemy did this,’ he replied. \n  So the servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’ \n   \n","‘No,’ he said, ‘if you pull the weeds now, you might uproot the wheat with them. \n","Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat into my barn.’” \n   \n","He put before them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man planted in his field. \n","Although it is the smallest of all seeds, yet it grows into the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.” \n   \n","He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.” \n   \n","Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables. He did not tell them anything without using a parable. \n","So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: \n  “I will open My mouth in parables; \n I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.” \n   \n","Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to Him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.” \n   \n","He replied, “The One who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. \n","The field is the world, and the good seed represents the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, \n","and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. \n   \n","As the weeds are collected and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age. \n","The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom every cause of sin and all who practice lawlessness. \n","And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \n","Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. \n  He who has ears, let him hear. \n   \n","The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and in his joy he went and sold all he had and bought that field. \n   \n","Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls. \n","When he found one very precious pearl, he went away and sold all he had and bought it. \n   \n","Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and caught all kinds of fish. \n","When it was full, the men pulled it ashore. Then they sat down and sorted the good fish into containers, but threw the bad away. \n   \n","So will it be at the end of the age: The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous, \n","and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \n   \n","Have you understood all these things?” \n  “Yes,” they answered. \n   \n","Then He told them, “For this reason, every scribe who has been discipled in the kingdom of heaven is like a homeowner who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.” \n   \n","When Jesus had finished these parables, He withdrew from that place. \n","Coming to His hometown, He taught the people in their synagogue, and they were astonished. “Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?” they asked. \n","“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son?

When evening came, He was there alone, \n","but the boat was already far  from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. \n   \n","During the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea. \n","When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said, and cried out in fear. \n   \n","But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I.

For He said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” \n   \n","In the same way, even the robbers who were crucified with Him berated Him. \n   \n","From the sixth hour until the ninth hour  darkness came over all the land. \n","About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli,  lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” \n   \n","When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He is calling Elijah.” \n","One of them quickly ran and brought a sponge. He filled it with sour wine,  put it on a reed, and held it up for Jesus to drink. \n   \n","But the others said, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to save Him.” \n   \n","When Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, He yielded up His spirit. \n","At that moment the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split. \n","The tombs broke open, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised. \n","After Jesus’ resurrection, when they had come out of the tombs, they entered the holy city and appeared to many people. \n   \n","When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and said, “Truly this was the Son of God.” \n   \n","And many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to minister to Him. \n","Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons. \n   \n","When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who himself was a disciple of Jesus. \n","He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. \n","So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, \n","and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance to the tomb and went away. \n","Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. \n   \n","The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and Pharisees assembled before Pilate. \n","“Sir,” they said, “we remember that while He was alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ \n","So give the order that the tomb be secured until the third day. Otherwise, His disciples may come and steal Him away and tell the people He has risen from the dead. And this last deception would be worse than the first.” \n   \n","“You have a guard,” Pilate said. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.” \n","So they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting the guard. \n"],["After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. \n   \n","Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it. \n","His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. \n","The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men. \n   \n","But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. \n","He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay. \n","Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.” \n   \n","So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples. \n","Suddenly  Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him. \n","“Do not be afraid,” said Jesus. “Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.” \n   \n","While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. \n","And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money \n","and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’ \n","If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” \n   \n","So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day. \n   \n","Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated. \n","When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted. \n   \n","Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. \n","Therefore go and make disciples  of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, \n","and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” "]],"Mark":[["This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. \n","As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: \n  “Behold, I will send My messenger ahead of You, \n who will prepare Your way.” \n  \n","“A voice of one calling in the wilderness, \n ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, \n make straight paths for Him.’” \n   \n","John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. \n","People went out to him from all of Jerusalem and the countryside of Judea. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. \n   \n","John was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. \n","And he began to proclaim: “After me will come One more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. \n","I baptize you with water,  but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. ” \n   \n","In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. \n","As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, He saw  the heavens breaking open and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove. \n","And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.” \n   \n","At once the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness, \n","and He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him. \n   \n","After the arrest of John, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God. \n","“The time is fulfilled,” He said, “and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!” \n   \n","As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. \n","“Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.” \n","And at once they left their nets and followed Him. \n   \n","Going on a little farther, He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets. \n","Immediately Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him. \n   \n","Then Jesus and His companions went to Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach. \n","The people were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. \n   \n","Suddenly a man with an unclean spirit cried out in the synagogue: \n","“What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!” \n   \n","But Jesus rebuked the spirit. “Be silent!” He said. “Come out of him!” \n","At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out with a loud shriek. \n   \n","All the people were amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!” \n","And the news about Jesus spread quickly through the whole region of Galilee. \n   \n","As soon as Jesus and His companions had left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. \n","Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever, and they promptly told Jesus about her. \n","So He went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them. \n   \n","That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all who were sick and demon-possessed, \n","and the whole town gathered at the door. \n","And He healed many who were ill with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was. \n   \n","Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up and slipped out to a solitary place to pray. \n","Simon and his companions went to look for Him, \n","and when they found Him, they said, “Everyone is looking for You!” \n   \n","But Jesus answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns so I can preach there as well, for that is why I have come.” \n","So He went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. \n   \n","Then a leper  came to Jesus, begging on his knees: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.” \n   \n","Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” \n","And immediately the leprosy left him, and the man was cleansed. \n   \n","Jesus promptly sent him away with a stern warning: \n","“See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.” \n   \n","But the man went out and openly began to proclaim and spread the news. \n  Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter. \n"],["A few days later Jesus went back to Capernaum. And when the people heard that He was home, \n","they gathered in such large numbers that there was no more room, not even outside the door, as Jesus spoke the word to them. \n   \n","Then a paralytic was brought to Him, carried by four men. \n","Since they were unable to get to Jesus through the crowd, they uncovered the roof above Him, made an opening, and lowered the paralytic on his mat. \n   \n","When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” \n   \n","But some of the scribes were sitting there and thinking in their hearts, \n","“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” \n   \n","At once Jesus knew in His spirit that they were thinking this way within themselves. “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?” He asked. \n","“Which is easier: to say to a paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk’? \n","But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...” He said to the paralytic, \n","“I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home.” \n   \n","And immediately the man got up, picked up his mat, and walked out in front of them all. As a result, they were all astounded and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!” \n   \n","Once again Jesus went out beside the sea. All the people came to Him, and He taught them there. \n   \n","As He was walking along, He saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth. “Follow Me,” He told him, and Levi got up and followed Him. \n   \n","While Jesus was dining at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Him and His disciples—for there were many who followed Him. \n","When the scribes who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with these people, they asked His disciples, “Why does He eat  with tax collectors and sinners?” \n   \n","On hearing this, Jesus told them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” \n   \n","Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were often fasting. So people came to Jesus and asked, “Why don’t Your disciples fast like John’s disciples and those of the Pharisees?” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while He is with them? As long as He is with them, they cannot fast. \n","But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. \n   \n","No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, and a worse tear will result. \n   \n","And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins.” \n   \n","One Sabbath Jesus was passing through the grainfields, and His disciples began to pick the heads of grain as they walked along. \n","So the Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? \n","During the high priesthood of Abiathar, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which was lawful only for the priests. And he gave some to his companions as well.” \n   \n","Then Jesus declared, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. \n","Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.” \n"],["Once again Jesus entered the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there. \n","In order to accuse Jesus, they were watching to see if He would heal on the Sabbath. \n   \n","Then Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up among us.” \n","And He asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?” \n  But they were silent. \n   \n","Jesus looked around at them with anger and sorrow at their hardness of heart. Then He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out, and it was restored. \n   \n","At this, the Pharisees went out and began plotting with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. \n   \n","So Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, accompanied by a large crowd from Galilee, Judea, \n","Jerusalem, Idumea, the region beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon. The large crowd came to Him when they heard what great things He was doing. \n   \n","Jesus asked His disciples to have a boat ready for Him so that the crowd would not crush Him. \n","For He had healed so many that all who had diseases were pressing forward to touch Him. \n","And when the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and cried out, “You are the Son of God!” \n","But He warned them sternly not to make Him known. \n   \n","Then Jesus went up on the mountain and called for those He wanted, and they came to Him. \n","He appointed twelve of them, whom He designated as apostles, to accompany Him, to be sent out to preach, \n","and to have authority to drive out demons. \n   \n","These are the twelve He appointed: Simon (whom He named Peter), \n","James son of Zebedee and his brother John (whom He named Boanerges, meaning “Sons of Thunder”), \n","Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, \n","and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus. \n   \n","Then Jesus went home, and once again a crowd gathered, so that He and His disciples could not even eat. \n","When His family heard about this, they went out to take custody of Him, saying, “He is out of His mind.” \n   \n","And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul, ” and, “By the prince of the demons He drives out demons.” \n   \n","So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan? \n","If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand. \n","If a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand. \n","And if Satan is divided and rises against himself, he cannot stand; his end has come. \n","Indeed, no one can enter a strong man’s house to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house. \n   \n","Truly I tell you, the sons of men will be forgiven all sins and blasphemies, as many as they utter. \n","But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of eternal sin.” \n   \n","Jesus made this statement because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.” \n   \n","Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came and stood outside. They sent someone in to summon Him, \n","and a crowd was sitting around Him. “Look,” He was told, “Your mother and brothers  are outside, asking for You.” \n   \n","But Jesus replied, “Who are My mother and My brothers?” \n","Looking at those seated in a circle around Him, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers! \n","For whoever does the will of God is My brother and sister and mother.” \n"],["Once again Jesus began to teach beside the sea, and such a large crowd gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people crowded along the shore. \n   \n","And He taught them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said, \n","“Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed. \n","And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. \n   \n","Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow. \n","But when the sun rose, the seedlings were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. \n   \n","Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings, and they yielded no crop. \n   \n","Still other seed fell on good soil, where it sprouted, grew up, and produced a crop—one bearing thirtyfold, another sixtyfold, and another a hundredfold.” \n   \n","Then Jesus said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” \n   \n","As soon as Jesus was alone with the Twelve and those around Him, they asked Him about the parable. \n   \n","He replied, “The mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those on the outside everything is expressed in parables, \n","so that, \n  ‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, \n and ever hearing but never understanding; \n otherwise they might turn \n and be forgiven.’ ” \n   \n","Then Jesus said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand any of the parables? \n   \n","The farmer sows the word. \n","Some are like the seeds  along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. \n   \n","Some are like the seeds sown on rocky ground. They hear the word and at once receive it with joy. \n","But they themselves have no root, and they remain for only a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. \n   \n","Others are like the seeds sown among the thorns. They hear the word, \n","but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. \n   \n","Still others are like the seeds sown on good soil. They hear the word, receive it, and produce a crop—thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold.” \n   \n","Jesus also said to them, “Does anyone bring in a lamp to put it under a basket or under a bed? Doesn’t he set it on a stand? \n","For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light. \n   \n","If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.” \n   \n","He went on to say, “Pay attention to what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and even more will be added to you. \n","For whoever has will be given more. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.” \n   \n","Jesus also said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground. \n","Night and day he sleeps and wakes, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he knows not how. \n","All by itself the earth produces a crop—first the stalk, then the head, then grain that ripens within. \n","And as soon as the grain is ripe, he swings the sickle, because the harvest has come. ” \n   \n","Then He asked, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God? With what parable shall we present it? \n","It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds sown upon the earth. \n","But after it is planted, it grows to be the largest of all garden plants and puts forth great branches, so that the birds of the air nest in its shade.” \n   \n","With many such parables Jesus spoke the word to them, to the extent that they could understand. \n","He did not tell them anything without using a parable. But privately He explained everything to His own disciples. \n   \n","When that evening came, He said to His disciples, “Let us cross to the other side.” \n","After they had dismissed the crowd, they took Jesus with them, since He was already in the boat. And there were other boats with Him. \n   \n","Soon a violent windstorm came up, and the waves were breaking over the boat, so that it was being swamped. \n","But Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. So they woke Him and said, “Teacher, don’t You care that we are perishing?” \n   \n","Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and the sea. “Silence!” He commanded. “Be still!” And the wind died down, and it was perfectly calm. \n   \n","“Why are you so afraid?” He asked. “Do you still have no faith?” \n   \n","Overwhelmed with fear, they asked one another, “Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?” \n"],["On the other side of the sea, they arrived in the region of the Gerasenes. \n","As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, He was met by a man with an unclean spirit, who was coming from the tombs. \n","This man had been living in the tombs and could no longer be restrained, even with chains. \n","Though he was often bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and shattered the shackles. Now there was no one with the strength to subdue him. \n","Night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he kept crying out and cutting himself with stones. \n   \n","When the man saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees before Him. \n","And he shouted in a loud voice, “What do You want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You before God not to torture me!” \n","For Jesus had already declared, “Come out of this man, you unclean spirit!” \n   \n","“What is your name?” Jesus asked. \n  “My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.” \n","And he begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of that region. \n   \n","There on the nearby hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding. \n","So the demons begged Jesus, “Send us to the pigs, so that we may enter them.” \n   \n","He gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the water. \n   \n","Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. \n","When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. \n   \n","Those who had seen it described what had happened to the demon-possessed man and also to the pigs. \n","And the people began to beg Jesus to leave their region. \n   \n","As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by the demons begged to go with Him. \n","But Jesus would not allow him. “Go home to your own people,” He said, “and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy He has shown you.” \n   \n","So the man went away and began to proclaim throughout the Decapolis  how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed. \n   \n","When Jesus had again crossed by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him beside the sea. \n","A synagogue leader named Jairus arrived, and seeing Jesus, he fell at His feet \n","and pleaded with Him urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Please come and place Your hands on her, so that she will be healed and live.” \n   \n","So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around Him. \n","And a woman was there who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years. \n","She had borne much agony under the care of many physicians and had spent all she had, but to no avail. Instead, her condition had only grown worse. \n   \n","When the woman heard about Jesus, she came up through the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak. \n","For she kept saying, “If only I touch His garments, I will be healed.” \n","Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she sensed in her body that she was healed of her affliction. \n   \n","At once Jesus was aware that power had gone out from Him. Turning to the crowd, He asked, “Who touched My garments?” \n   \n","His disciples answered, “You can see the crowd pressing in on You, and yet You ask, ‘Who touched Me?’” \n   \n","But He kept looking around to see who had done this. \n","Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him trembling in fear, and she told Him the whole truth. \n   \n","“Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free of your affliction.” \n   \n","While He was still speaking, messengers from the house of Jairus arrived and said, “Your daughter is dead; why bother the Teacher anymore?” \n   \n","But Jesus overheard  their conversation and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe.” \n","And He did not allow anyone to accompany Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. \n   \n","When they arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw the commotion and the people weeping and wailing loudly. \n","He went inside and asked, “Why all this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but asleep.” \n","And they laughed at Him. \n  After He had put them all outside, He took the child’s father and mother and His own companions, and went in to see the child. \n","Taking her by the hand, Jesus said, “Talitha koum!” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!” \n","Immediately the girl got up and began to walk around. She was twelve years old, and at once they were utterly astounded. \n","Then Jesus gave strict orders that no one should know about this, and He told them to give her something to eat. \n"],["Jesus went on from there and came to His hometown, accompanied by His disciples. \n","When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard Him were astonished. “Where did this man get these ideas?” they asked. “What is this wisdom He has been given? And how can He perform such miracles? \n","Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Aren’t His sisters here with us as well?” And they took offense at Him. \n   \n","Then Jesus said to them, “Only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household is a prophet without honor.” \n","So He could not perform any miracles there, except to lay His hands on a few of the sick and heal them. \n","And He was amazed at their unbelief. \n  And He went around from village to village, teaching the people. \n   \n","Then Jesus called the Twelve to Him and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits. \n","He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey—no bread, no bag, no money  in their belts—\n","and to wear sandals, but not a second tunic. \n   \n","And He told them, “When you enter a house, stay there until you leave that area. \n","If anyone will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that place, as a testimony against them.” \n   \n","So they set out and preached that the people should repent. \n","They also drove out many demons and healed many of the sick, anointing them with oil. \n   \n","Now King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known, and people were saying, “John the Baptist has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.” \n","Others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and still others, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.” \n   \n","But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has risen from the dead!” \n","For Herod himself had ordered that John be arrested and bound and imprisoned, on account of his brother Philip’s wife Herodias, whom Herod had married. \n","For John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife!” \n   \n","So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she had been unable, \n","because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard John’s words, he was greatly perplexed; yet he listened to him gladly. \n   \n","On Herod’s birthday, her opportunity arose. Herod held a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. \n","When the daughter of Herodias  came and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests, and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.” \n","And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom!” \n   \n","Then she went out and asked her mother, “What should I request?” \n  And her mother answered, “The head of John the Baptist.” \n   \n","At once the girl hurried back to the king with her request: “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.” \n   \n","The king was consumed with sorrow, but because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her. \n","So without delay, the king commanded that John’s head be brought in. He sent an executioner, who went and beheaded him in the prison. \n","The man brought John’s head on a platter and presented it to the girl, who gave it to her mother. \n   \n","When John’s disciples heard about this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb. \n   \n","Meanwhile, the apostles gathered around Jesus and brought Him news of all they had done and taught. \n","And He said to them, “Come with Me privately to a solitary place, and let us rest for a while.” For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat. \n   \n","So they went away in a boat by themselves to a solitary place. \n","But many people saw them leaving and recognized them. They ran together on foot from all the towns and arrived before them. \n","When Jesus stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things. \n   \n","By now the hour was already late. So the disciples came to Jesus and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late. \n","Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.” \n   \n","But Jesus told them, “You give them something to eat.” \n  They asked Him, “Should we go out and spend two hundred denarii  to give all of them bread to eat?” \n   \n","“Go and see how many loaves you have,” He told them. \n  And after checking, they said, “Five—and two fish.” \n   \n","Then Jesus directed them to have the people sit in groups on the green grass. \n","So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. \n   \n","Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke the loaves. Then He gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And He divided the two fish among them all. \n   \n","They all ate and were satisfied, \n","and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. \n","And there were five thousand men who had eaten the loaves. \n   \n","Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd. \n","After bidding them farewell, He went up on the mountain to pray. \n   \n","When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and Jesus was alone on land. \n","He could see that the disciples were straining to row, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea. He intended to pass by them, \n","but when they saw Him walking on the sea, they cried out, thinking He was a ghost—\n","for they all saw Him and were terrified. \n  But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.” \n","Then He climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. And the disciples were utterly astounded, \n","for they had not understood about the loaves, but their hearts had been hardened. \n   \n","When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and moored the boat. \n","As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus \n","and ran through that whole region, carrying the sick on mats to wherever they heard He was. \n","And wherever He went—villages and towns and countrysides—they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed. \n"],["Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus, \n","and they saw some of His disciples eating with hands that were defiled—that is, unwashed. \n   \n","Now in holding to the tradition of the elders, the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat until they wash their hands ceremonially. \n","And on returning from the market, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions for them to observe, including the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles, and couches for dining. \n   \n","So the Pharisees and scribes questioned Jesus: “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with defiled hands.” \n   \n","Jesus answered them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: \n  ‘These people honor Me with their lips, \n but their hearts are far from Me. \n  \n","They worship Me in vain; \n they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’ \n   \n","You have disregarded the commandment of God to keep the tradition of men. ” \n   \n","He went on to say, “You neatly set aside the command of God to maintain  your own tradition. \n","For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’  and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’ \n","But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is Corban’ (that is, a gift devoted to God), \n","he is no longer permitted to do anything for his father or mother. \n","Thus you nullify the word of God by the tradition you have handed down. And you do so in many such matters.” \n   \n","Once again Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, “All of you, listen to Me and understand: \n","Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him; but the things that come out of a man, these are what defile him.” \n   \n",null,"After Jesus had left the crowd and gone into the house, His disciples inquired about the parable. \n   \n","“Are you still so dull?” He asked. “Do you not understand? Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him, \n","because it does not enter his heart, but it goes into the stomach and then is eliminated.” (Thus all foods are clean.) \n   \n","He continued: “What comes out of a man, that is what defiles him. \n","For from within the hearts of men come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, \n","greed, wickedness, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, arrogance, and foolishness. \n","All these evils come from within, and these are what defile a man.” \n   \n","Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre. Not wanting anyone to know He was there, He entered a house, but was unable to escape their notice. \n","Instead, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit soon heard about Jesus, and she came and fell at His feet. \n","Now she was a Greek woman of Syrophoenician origin, and she kept asking Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. \n   \n","“First let the children have their fill,” He said. “For it is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.” \n   \n","“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “even the dogs  under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” \n   \n","Then Jesus told her, “Because of this answer, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.” \n","And she went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone. \n   \n","Then Jesus left the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. \n","Some people brought to Him a man who was deaf and hardly able to speak, and they begged Jesus to place His hand on him. \n   \n","So Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, and put His fingers into the man’s ears. Then He spit and touched the man’s tongue. \n","And looking up to heaven, He sighed deeply and said to him, “Ephphatha!” (which means, “Be opened!”). \n","Immediately the man’s ears were opened and his tongue was released, and he began to speak plainly. \n   \n","Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone. But the more He ordered them, the more widely they proclaimed it. \n"],["In those days the crowd once again became very large, and they had nothing to eat. Jesus called the disciples to Him and said, \n","“I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat. \n","If I send them home hungry, they will faint along the way. For some of them have come a great distance.” \n   \n","His disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could anyone find enough bread to feed all these people?” \n   \n","“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. \n  “Seven,” they replied. \n   \n","And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then He took the seven loaves, gave thanks and broke them, and gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And they distributed them to the crowd. \n","They also had a few small fish, and Jesus blessed them and ordered that these be set before them as well. \n   \n","The people ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. \n","And about four thousand men  were present. \n  As soon as Jesus had dismissed the crowd, \n","He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha. \n   \n","Then the Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus, testing Him by demanding from Him a sign from heaven. \n   \n","Jesus sighed deeply in His spirit and said, “Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.” \n","And He left them, got back into the boat, and crossed to the other side. \n   \n","Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. \n","“Watch out!” He cautioned them. “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod.” \n   \n","So they began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread. \n   \n","Aware of their conversation, Jesus asked them, “Why are you debating about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Do you have such hard hearts? \n","‘Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear?’ And do you not remember? \n","When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you collect?” \n  “Twelve,” they answered. \n   \n","“And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you collect?” \n  “Seven,” they said. \n   \n","Then He asked them, “Do you still not understand?” \n   \n","When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. \n","So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. Then He spit on the man’s eyes and placed His hands on him. “Can you see anything?” He asked. \n   \n","The man looked up and said, “I can see the people, but they look like trees walking around.” \n   \n","Once again Jesus placed His hands on the man’s eyes, and when he opened them his sight was restored, and he could see everything clearly. \n","Jesus sent him home and said, “Do not go back into the village.” \n   \n","Then Jesus and His disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way, He questioned His disciples: “Who do people say I am?” \n   \n","They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.” \n   \n","“But what about you?” Jesus asked. “Who do you say I am?” \n  Peter answered, “You are the Christ.” \n   \n","And Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about Him. \n   \n","Then He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and that He must be killed and after three days rise again. \n","He spoke this message quite frankly, and Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. \n   \n","But Jesus, turning and looking at His disciples, rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind Me, Satan! For you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.” \n   \n","Then Jesus called the crowd to Him along with His disciples, and He told them, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. \n","For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and for the gospel will save it. \n   \n","What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? \n","Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? \n","If anyone is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in His Father’s glory with the holy angels.” \n"],["Then Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God arrive with power.” \n   \n","After six days Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There He was transfigured before them. \n","His clothes became radiantly white, brighter than any launderer on earth could bleach them. \n","And Elijah and Moses appeared before them, talking with Jesus. \n   \n","Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters  —one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” \n","For they were all so terrified that Peter did not know what else to say. \n   \n","Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is My beloved Son. Listen to Him!” \n","Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one with them except Jesus. \n   \n","As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus admonished them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. \n","So they kept this matter to themselves, discussing what it meant to rise from the dead. \n","And they asked Jesus, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” \n   \n","He replied, “Elijah does indeed come first, and he restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected? \n","But I tell you that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they wished, just as it is written about him.” \n   \n","When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. \n","As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were filled with awe and ran to greet Him. \n   \n","“What are you disputing with them?” He asked. \n   \n","Someone in the crowd replied, “Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a spirit that makes him mute. \n","Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked Your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.” \n   \n","“O unbelieving generation!” Jesus replied. “How long must I remain with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to Me.” \n   \n","So they brought him, and seeing Jesus, the spirit immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. \n   \n","Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has this been with him?” \n  “From childhood,” he said. \n","“It often throws him into the fire or into the water, trying to kill him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” \n   \n","“If You can?” echoed Jesus. “All things are possible to him who believes!” \n   \n","Immediately the boy’s father cried out, “I do believe; help my unbelief!” \n   \n","When Jesus saw that a crowd had come running, He rebuked the unclean spirit. “You deaf and mute spirit,” He said, “I command you to come out and never enter him again.” \n   \n","After shrieking and convulsing him violently, the spirit came out. The boy became like a corpse, so that many said, “He is dead.” \n","But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up. \n   \n","After Jesus had gone into the house, His disciples asked Him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “This kind cannot come out, except by prayer.” \n   \n","Going on from there, they passed through Galilee. But Jesus did not want anyone to know, \n","because He was teaching His disciples. He told them, “The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill Him, and after three days He will rise.” \n","But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him about it. \n   \n","Then they came to Capernaum. While Jesus was in the house, He asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?” \n","But they were silent, for on the way they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. \n   \n","Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be the last of all and the servant of all.” \n   \n","Then He had a little child stand among them. Taking the child in His arms, He said to them, \n","“Whoever welcomes one of these little children in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me welcomes not only Me, but the One who sent Me.” \n   \n","John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw someone else driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not accompany us.” \n   \n","“Do not stop him,” Jesus replied. “For no one who performs a miracle in My name can turn around and speak evil of Me. \n","For whoever is not against us is for us. \n","Indeed, if anyone gives you even a cup of water because you bear the name of Christ, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward. \n   \n","But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the sea. \n   \n","If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two hands and go into hell,  into the unquenchable fire. \n",null,"If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. \n",null,"And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, \n","where ‘their worm never dies, and the fire is never quenched.’ \n   \n"],["Then Jesus left that place and went into the region of Judea, beyond the Jordan. Again the crowds came to Him and He taught them, as was His custom. \n   \n","Some Pharisees came to test Him. “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” they inquired. \n   \n","“What did Moses command you?” He replied. \n   \n","They answered, “Moses permitted a man to write his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away.” \n   \n","But Jesus told them, “Moses wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart. \n","However, from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ \n","‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, \n","and the two will become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh. \n","Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.” \n   \n","When they were back inside the house, the disciples asked Jesus about this matter. \n","So He told them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. \n","And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.” \n   \n","Now people were bringing the little children to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them, and the disciples rebuked those who brought them. \n   \n","But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and told them, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. \n","Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” \n","And He took the children in His arms, placed His hands on them, and blessed them. \n   \n","As Jesus started on His way, a man ran up and knelt before Him. “Good Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” \n   \n","“Why do you call Me good?” Jesus replied. “No one is good except God alone. \n","You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not cheat others, honor your father and mother.’ ” \n   \n","“Teacher,” he replied, “all these I have kept from my youth.” \n   \n","Jesus looked at him, loved him, and said to him, “There is one thing you lack: Go, sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me. ” \n   \n","But the man was saddened by these words and went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth. \n   \n","Then Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!” \n   \n","And the disciples were amazed at His words. \n  But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is to enter  the kingdom of God! \n","It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” \n   \n","They were even more astonished and said to one another, “Who then can be saved?” \n   \n","Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.” \n   \n","Peter began to say to Him, “Look, we have left everything and followed You.” \n   \n","“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel \n","will fail to receive a hundredfold in the present age—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life. \n","But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.” \n   \n","As they were going up the road to Jerusalem, Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples were amazed, but those who followed were afraid. Again Jesus took the Twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him: \n","“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn Him to death and will deliver Him over to the Gentiles, \n","who will mock Him and spit on Him and flog Him and kill Him. And after three days He will rise again.” \n   \n","Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and declared, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask.” \n   \n","“What do you want Me to do for you?” He inquired. \n   \n","They answered, “Grant that one of us may sit at Your right hand and the other at Your left in Your glory.” \n   \n","“You do not know what you are asking,” Jesus replied. “Can you drink the cup I will drink, or be baptized with the baptism I will undergo?” \n   \n","“We can,” the brothers answered. \n  “You will drink the cup that I drink,” Jesus said, “and you will be baptized with the baptism that I undergo. \n","But to sit at My right or left is not Mine to grant. These seats belong to those for whom  they have been prepared.” \n   \n","When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. \n","So Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors exercise authority over them. \n","But it shall not be this way among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, \n","and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all. \n","For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.” \n   \n","Next, they came to Jericho. And as Jesus and His disciples were leaving Jericho with a large crowd, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting beside the road. \n","When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” \n   \n","Many people admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” \n   \n","Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” \n  So they called the blind man. “Take courage!” they said. “Get up! He is calling for you.” \n   \n","Throwing off his cloak, Bartimaeus jumped up and came to Jesus. \n   \n","“What do you want Me to do for you?” Jesus asked. \n  “Rabboni,” said the blind man, “let me see again.” \n   \n","“Go,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you.” And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road. \n"],["As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent out two of His disciples \n","and said to them, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. \n","If anyone asks, ‘Why are you doing this?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it and will return it shortly.’” \n   \n","So they went and found the colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. They untied it, \n","and some who were standing there asked, “Why are you untying the colt?” \n   \n","The disciples answered as Jesus had instructed them, and the people gave them permission. \n","Then they led the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, and He sat on it. \n   \n","Many in the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut from the fields. \n","The ones who went ahead and those who followed were shouting: \n  “Hosanna!” \n  “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!” \n   \n","“Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!” \n  “Hosanna in the highest!” \n   \n","Then Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, He went out to Bethany with the Twelve. \n   \n","The next day, when they had left Bethany, Jesus was hungry. \n","Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if there was any fruit on it. But when He reached it, He found nothing on it except leaves, since it was not the season for figs. \n","Then He said to the tree, “May no one ever eat of your fruit again.” And His disciples heard this statement. \n   \n","When they arrived in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves. \n","And He would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. \n","Then Jesus began to teach them, and He declared, “Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’ ? But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’ ” \n   \n","When the chief priests and scribes heard this, they looked for a way to kill Him. For they were afraid of Him, because the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching. \n   \n","And when evening came, Jesus and His disciples went  out of the city. \n   \n","As they were walking back in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from its roots. \n","Peter remembered it and said, “Look, Rabbi! The fig tree You cursed has withered.” \n   \n","“Have faith in God,” Jesus said to them. \n","“Truly I tell you that if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and has no doubt in his heart but believes that it will happen, it will be done for him. \n","Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. \n   \n","And when you stand to pray, if you hold anything against another, forgive it, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your trespasses as well. ” \n   \n",null,"After their return to Jerusalem, Jesus was walking in the temple courts, and the chief priests, scribes, and elders came up to Him. \n","“By what authority are You doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave You the authority to do them?” \n   \n","“I will ask you one question,” Jesus replied, “and if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. \n","John’s baptism—was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me!” \n   \n","They deliberated among themselves what they should answer: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ \n","But if we say, ‘From men’...” they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John truly was a prophet. \n"],["Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a wine vat, and built a watchtower. Then he rented it out to some tenants and went away on a journey. \n   \n","At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. \n","But they seized the servant, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. \n   \n","Then he sent them another servant, and they struck him over the head and treated him shamefully. \n   \n","He sent still another, and this one they killed. \n  He sent many others; some they beat and others they killed. \n   \n","Finally, having one beloved son, he sent him to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said. \n   \n","But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ \n","So they seized the son, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. \n   \n","What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants, and will give the vineyard to others. \n","Have you never read this Scripture: \n  ‘The stone the builders rejected \n has become the cornerstone. \n  \n","This is from the Lord, \n and it is marvelous in our eyes’ ?” \n   \n","At this, the leaders sought  to arrest Jesus, for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them. But fearing the crowd, they left Him and went away. \n   \n","Later, they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to catch Jesus in His words. \n","“Teacher,” they said, “we know that You are honest and seek favor from no one. Indeed, You are impartial and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or not?” \n   \n","But Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said, “Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius  to inspect.” \n","So they brought it, and He asked them, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?” \n  “Caesar’s,” they answered. \n   \n","Then Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” \n  And they marveled at Him. \n   \n","Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and questioned Him: \n","“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up offspring for him. \n","Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died, leaving no children. \n","Then the second one married the widow, but he also died and left no children. And the third did likewise. \n","In this way, none of the seven left any children. And last of all, the woman died. \n","In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.” \n   \n","Jesus said to them, “Aren’t you mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? \n","When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage.

You are badly mistaken!” \n   \n","Now one of the scribes had come up and heard their debate. Noticing how well Jesus had answered them, he asked Him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “This is the most important: ‘Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One. \n","Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ \n","The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ No other commandment is greater than these.” \n   \n","“Right, Teacher,” the scribe replied. “You have stated correctly that God is One and there is no other but Him, \n","and to love Him with all your heart and with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, which is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.” \n   \n","When Jesus saw that the man had answered wisely, He said, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” \n  And no one dared to question Him any further. \n   \n","While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, He asked, “How can the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David? \n","Speaking by the Holy Spirit, David himself declared: \n  ‘The Lord said to my Lord, \n “Sit at My right hand \n until I put Your enemies \n under Your feet.”’ \n   \n","David himself calls Him ‘Lord.’ So how can He be David’s son?” \n  And the large crowd listened to Him with delight. \n   \n","In His teaching Jesus also said, “Watch out for the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, to receive greetings in the marketplaces, \n","and to have the chief seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. \n","They defraud widows of their houses, and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater condemnation.” \n   \n","As Jesus was sitting opposite the treasury, He watched the crowd putting money into it. And many rich people put in large amounts. \n","Then one poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amounted to a small fraction of a denarius. \n   \n","Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more than all the others into the treasury. \n","For they all contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.” \n"],["As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, “Teacher, look at the magnificent stones and buildings!” \n   \n","“Do you see all these great buildings?” Jesus replied. “Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.” \n   \n","While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately, \n","“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to be fulfilled?” \n   \n","Jesus began by telling them, “See to it that no one deceives you. \n","Many will come in My name, claiming, ‘I am He,’ and will deceive many. \n","When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. These things must happen, but the end is still to come. \n","Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, as well as famines.

On My account you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them. \n","And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations. \n","But when they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand what to say. Instead, speak whatever you are given at that time, for it will not be you speaking, but the Holy Spirit. \n   \n","Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise against their parents and have them put to death. \n","You will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved. \n   \n","So when you see the abomination of desolation   standing where it should not be  (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. \n","Let no one on the housetop go back inside to retrieve anything from his house. \n","And let no one in the field return for his cloak. \n   \n","How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! \n","Pray that this will not occur in the winter. \n","For those will be days of tribulation unmatched from the beginning of God’s creation until now, and never to be seen again. \n","If the Lord had not cut short those days, nobody would be saved.

For out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks. \n   \n","Why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ but not do what I say? \n","I will show you what he is like who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them: \n","He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid his foundation on the rock. When the flood came, the torrent crashed against that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. \n   \n","But the one who hears My words and does not act on them is like a man who built his house on ground without a foundation. The torrent crashed against that house, and immediately it fell—and great was its destruction!” \n"],["When Jesus had concluded His discourse in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum. \n","There a highly valued servant of a centurion was sick and about to die. \n","When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to ask Him to come and heal his servant. \n","They came to Jesus and pleaded with Him earnestly, “This man is worthy to have You grant this, \n","for he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.” \n   \n","So Jesus went with them. But when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends with the message: “Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy to have You come under my roof. \n","That is why I did not consider myself worthy to come to You. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. \n","For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes; and another to come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.” \n   \n","When Jesus heard this, He marveled at the centurion. Turning to the crowd following Him, He said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.” \n","And when the messengers returned to the house, they found the servant in good health. \n   \n","Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain. His disciples went with Him, accompanied by a large crowd. \n","As He approached the town gate, He saw a dead man being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. \n   \n","When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said, “Do not weep.” \n","Then He went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. “Young man,” He said, “I tell you, get up!” \n","And the dead man sat up and began to speak! Then Jesus gave him back to his mother. \n   \n","A sense of awe swept over all of them, and they glorified God. “A great prophet has appeared among us!” they said. “God has visited His people!” \n","And the news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding region. \n   \n","Then John’s disciples informed him about all these things. \n","So John called two of his disciples and sent them to ask the Lord, “Are You the One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?” \n   \n","When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to ask, ‘Are You the One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?’” \n   \n","At that very hour Jesus healed many people of their diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits, and He gave sight to many who were blind. \n","So He replied, “Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers  are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. \n","Blessed is the one who does not fall away on account of Me. ” \n   \n","After John’s messengers had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind? \n","Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who wear elegant clothing and live in luxury are found in palaces. \n   \n","What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. \n","This is the one about whom it is written: \n  ‘Behold, I will send My messenger ahead of You, \n who will prepare Your way before You.’ \n   \n","I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John, yet even the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” \n   \n","All the people who heard this, even the tax collectors, acknowledged God’s justice. For they had received the baptism of John. \n","But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John. \n   \n","“To what, then, can I compare the men of this generation? What are they like? \n","They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another: \n  ‘We played the flute for you, \n and you did not dance; \n we sang a dirge, \n and you did not weep.’ \n   \n","For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’ \n","The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at this glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ \n","But wisdom is vindicated by all her children.” \n   \n","Then one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him, and He entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. \n","When a sinful woman from that town learned that Jesus was dining there, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume. \n","As she stood behind Him at His feet weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears and wipe them with her hair. Then she kissed His feet and anointed them with the perfume. \n   \n","When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, He would know who this is and what kind of woman is touching Him—for she is a sinner!” \n   \n","But Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” \n  “Tell me, Teacher,” he said. \n   \n","“Two men were debtors to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. \n","When they were unable to repay him, he forgave both of them. Which one, then, will love him more?” \n   \n","“I suppose the one who was forgiven more,” Simon replied. \n  “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said. \n   \n","And turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? When I entered your house, you did not give Me water for My feet, but she wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. \n","You did not greet Me with a kiss, but she has not stopped kissing My feet since I arrived. \n","You did not anoint My head with oil, but she has anointed My feet with perfume. \n","Therefore I tell you, because her many sins have been forgiven, she has loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.” \n   \n","Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” \n   \n","But those at the table began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” \n   \n","And Jesus told the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.” \n"],["Soon afterward, Jesus traveled from one town and village to another, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with Him, \n","as well as some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, \n","Joanna the wife of Herod’s household manager Chuza, Susanna, and many others. These women were ministering to them  out of their own means. \n   \n","While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, He told them this parable: \n","“A farmer went out to sow his seed. And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, where it was trampled, and the birds of the air devoured it. \n   \n","Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the seedlings withered because they had no moisture. \n   \n","Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the seedlings. \n   \n","Still other seed fell on good soil, where it sprang up and produced a crop—a hundredfold.” \n  As Jesus said this, He called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” \n   \n","Then His disciples asked Him what this parable meant. \n   \n","He replied, “The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, \n  ‘though seeing, they may not see; \n though hearing, they may not understand.’ \n   \n","Now this is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. \n","The seeds  along the path are those who hear, but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. \n   \n","The seeds on rocky ground are those who hear the word and receive it with joy, but they have no root. They believe for a season, but in the time of testing, they fall away. \n   \n","The seeds that fell among the thorns are those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the worries, riches, and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does not mature. \n   \n","But the seeds on good soil are those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, cling to it, and by persevering produce a crop. \n   \n","No one lights a lamp and covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light. \n","For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light. \n   \n","Pay attention, therefore, to how you listen. Whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.” \n   \n","Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see Him, but they were unable to reach Him because of the crowd. \n","He was told, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see You.” \n   \n","But He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear the word of God and carry it out.” \n   \n","One day Jesus said to His disciples, “Let us cross to the other side of the lake.” So He got into a boat with them and set out. \n   \n","As they sailed, He fell asleep, and a windstorm came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. \n","The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” \n  Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters, and they subsided, and all was calm. \n","“Where is your faith?” He asked. \n  Frightened and amazed, they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him!” \n   \n","Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, across the lake from Galilee. \n","When Jesus stepped ashore, He was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothing or lived in a house, but he stayed in the tombs. \n   \n","When the man saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, shouting in a loud voice, “What do You want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You not to torture me!” \n","For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and been driven by the demon into solitary places. \n   \n","“What is your name?” Jesus asked. \n  “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him. \n","And the demons kept begging Jesus not to order them to go into the Abyss. \n   \n","There on the hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding. So the demons begged Jesus to let them enter the pigs, and He gave them permission. \n   \n","Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. \n   \n","When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside. \n","So the people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man whom the demons had left, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. \n","Meanwhile, those who had seen it reported how the demon-possessed man had been healed. \n   \n","Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart from them, because great fear had taken hold of them. So He got into the boat and started back. \n   \n","The man whom the demons had left begged to go with Jesus. But He sent him away, saying, \n","“Return home and describe how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and proclaimed all over the town how much Jesus had done for him. \n   \n","When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him. \n","Just then a synagogue leader named Jairus came and fell at Jesus’ feet. He begged Him to come to his house, \n","because his only daughter, who was about twelve, was dying. \n  As Jesus went with him, the crowds pressed around Him, \n","including a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years. She had spent all her money on physicians, but no one was able to heal her. \n","She came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. \n   \n","“Who touched Me?” Jesus asked. \n  But they all denied it. “Master,” said Peter, “the people are crowding and pressing against You.” \n   \n","But Jesus declared, “Someone touched Me, for I know that power has gone out from Me.” \n   \n","Then the woman, seeing that she could not escape notice, came trembling and fell down before Him. In the presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched Him and how she had immediately been healed. \n   \n","“Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace.” \n   \n","While He was still speaking, someone arrived from the house of the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he told Jairus. “Do not bother the Teacher anymore.” \n   \n","But Jesus overheard them and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.” \n   \n","When He entered the house, He did not allow anyone to go in with Him except Peter, John, James, and the child’s father and mother. \n","Meanwhile, everyone was weeping and mourning for her. But Jesus said, “Stop weeping; she is not dead but asleep.” \n","And they laughed at Him, knowing that she was dead. \n   \n","But Jesus took her by the hand and called out, “Child, get up!” \n","Her spirit returned, and at once she got up. And He directed that she be given something to eat. \n","Her parents were astounded, but Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened. \n"],["Then Jesus called the Twelve  together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and power to cure diseases. \n","And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. \n","“Take nothing for the journey,” He told them, “no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no second tunic. \n","Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that area. \n","If anyone does not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that town, as a testimony against them.” \n   \n","So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere. \n   \n","When Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, he was perplexed. For some were saying that John had risen from the dead, \n","others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that a prophet of old had arisen. \n   \n","“I beheaded John,” Herod said, “but who is this man I hear such things about?” And he kept trying to see Jesus. \n   \n","Then the apostles returned and reported to Jesus all that they had done. Taking them away privately, He withdrew to a town called Bethsaida. \n","But the crowds found out and followed Him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and He healed those who needed healing. \n   \n","As the day neared its end, the Twelve came to Jesus and said, “Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside for lodging and provisions. For we are in a desolate place here.” \n   \n","But Jesus told them, “You give them something to eat.” \n  “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered, “unless we go and buy food for all these people.” \n","(There were about five thousand men.) \n  He told His disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.” \n","They did so, and everyone was seated. \n   \n","Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples to set before the people. \n   \n","They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. \n   \n","One day as Jesus was praying in private and the disciples were with Him, He questioned them: “Who do the crowds say I am?” \n   \n","They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that a prophet of old has arisen.” \n   \n","“But what about you?” Jesus asked. “Who do you say I am?” \n  Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” \n   \n","Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. \n","“The Son of Man must suffer many things,” He said. “He must be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.” \n   \n","Then Jesus said to all of them, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me. \n","For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it. \n   \n","What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet lose or forfeit his very self? \n","If anyone is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. \n","But I tell you truthfully, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.” \n   \n","About eight days after Jesus had said these things, He took with Him Peter, John, and James, and went up on a mountain to pray. \n","And as He was praying, the appearance of His face changed, and His clothes became radiantly white. \n","Suddenly two men, Moses and Elijah, began talking with Jesus. \n","They appeared in glory and spoke about His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. \n   \n","Meanwhile Peter and his companions were overcome by sleep, but when they awoke, they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men standing with Him. \n","As Moses and Elijah were leaving, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters  —one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.) \n   \n","While Peter was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. \n","And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, whom I have chosen. Listen to Him!” \n   \n","After the voice had spoken, only Jesus was present with them. The disciples kept this to themselves, and in those days they did not tell anyone what they had seen. \n   \n","The next day, when they came down from the mountain, Jesus was met by a large crowd. \n","Suddenly a man in the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only child. \n","A spirit keeps seizing him, and he screams abruptly. It throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It keeps mauling him and rarely departs from him. \n","I begged Your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.” \n   \n","“O unbelieving and perverse generation!” Jesus replied. “How long must I remain with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.” \n   \n","Even while the boy was approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. \n   \n","And they were all astonished at the greatness of God. \n  While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus was doing, He said to His disciples, \n","“Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.” \n","But they did not understand this statement. It was veiled from them so that they could not comprehend it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it. \n   \n","Then an argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. \n","But Jesus, knowing the thoughts of their hearts, had a little child stand beside Him. \n","And He said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me welcomes the One who sent Me. For whoever is the least among all of you, he is the greatest.” \n   \n","“Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not accompany us.” \n   \n","“Do not stop him,” Jesus replied, “for whoever is not against you is for you.” \n   \n","As the day of His ascension approached, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. \n","He sent messengers on ahead, who went into a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him. \n","But the people there refused to welcome Him, because He was heading for Jerusalem. \n   \n","When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do You want us to call down fire from heaven  to consume them?” \n   \n","But Jesus turned and rebuked them. \n","And He and His disciples went on to another village. \n   \n","As they were walking along the road, someone said to Jesus, “I will follow You wherever You go.” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.” \n   \n","Then He said to another man, “Follow Me.” \n  The man replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” \n   \n","But Jesus told him, “Let the dead bury their own dead. You, however, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” \n   \n","Still another said, “I will follow You, Lord; but first let me bid farewell to my family.” \n   \n","Then Jesus declared, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and then looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.” \n"],["After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two  others and sent them two by two ahead of Him to every town and place He was about to visit. \n","And He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest. \n   \n","Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. \n","Carry no purse or bag or sandals. Do not greet anyone along the road. \n   \n","Whatever house you enter, begin by saying, ‘Peace to this house.’ \n","If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you. \n","Stay at the same house, eating and drinking whatever you are offered. For the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move around from house to house. \n   \n","If you enter a town and they welcome you, eat whatever is set before you. \n","Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you.’ \n   \n","But if you enter a town and they do not welcome you, go into the streets and declare, \n","‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off as a testimony against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.’ \n","I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town. \n   \n","Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. \n","But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. \n   \n","And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! \n   \n","Whoever listens to you listens to Me; whoever rejects you rejects Me; and whoever rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.” \n   \n","The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in Your name.” \n   \n","So He told them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. \n","Behold, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will harm you. \n","Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.” \n   \n","At that time Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and declared, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing in Your sight. \n   \n","All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.” \n   \n","Then Jesus turned to the disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. \n","For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.” \n   \n","One day an expert in the law stood up to test Him. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” \n   \n","“What is written in the Law?” Jesus replied. “How do you read it?” \n   \n","He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’  and ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ ” \n   \n","“You have answered correctly,” Jesus said. “Do this and you will live.” \n   \n","But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” \n   \n","Jesus took up this question and said, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead. \n   \n","Now by chance a priest was going down the same road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. \n   \n","So too, when a Levite came to that spot and saw him, he passed by on the other side. \n   \n","But when a Samaritan on a journey came upon him, he looked at him and had compassion. \n","He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. \n   \n","The next day he took out two denarii  and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Take care of him,’ he said, ‘and on my return I will repay you for any additional expense.’ \n   \n","Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?” \n   \n","“The one who showed him mercy,” replied the expert in the law. \n  Then Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.” \n   \n","As they traveled along, Jesus entered a village where a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home. \n","She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to His message. \n","But Martha was distracted by all the preparations to be made. She came to Jesus and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her to help me!” \n   \n","“Martha, Martha,” the Lord replied, “you are worried and upset about many things. \n","But only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.” \n"],["One day in a place where Jesus had just finished praying, one of His disciples requested, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” \n   \n","So Jesus told them, “When you pray, say: \n  ‘Father, hallowed be Your name. \n Your kingdom come. \n  \n","Give us each day our daily bread. \n  \n","And forgive us our sins, \n for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. \n And lead us not into temptation. ’” \n   \n","Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose one of you goes to his friend at midnight and says, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, \n","because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.’ \n   \n","And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Do not bother me. My door is already shut, and my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.’ \n   \n","I tell you, even though he will not get up to provide for him because of his friendship, yet because of the man’s persistence, he will get up and give him as much as he needs. \n   \n","So I tell you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. \n","For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. \n   \n","What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? \n","Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? \n","So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” \n   \n","One day Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. And when the demon was gone, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowds were amazed, \n","but some of them said, “It is by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons, that He drives out demons.” \n","And others tested Him by demanding a sign from heaven. \n   \n","Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste, and a house divided against a house will fall. \n","If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? After all, you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul. \n","And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. \n","But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. \n   \n","When a strong man, fully armed, guards his house, his possessions are secure. \n","But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted, and then he divides up his plunder. \n   \n","He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters. \n   \n","When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.

It demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. \n","For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation. \n   \n","The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon is here. \n","The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now One greater than Jonah is here. \n   \n","No one lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or under a basket. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light. \n   \n","Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good,  your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body is full of darkness. \n","Be careful, then, that the light within you is not darkness. \n","So if your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, you will be radiant, as though a lamp were shining on you.” \n   \n","As Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee invited Him to dine with him; so He went in and reclined at the table. \n","But the Pharisee was surprised to see that Jesus did not first wash before the meal. \n   \n","“Now then,” said the Lord, “you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. \n","You fools! Did not the One who made the outside make the inside as well? \n","But give as alms the things that are within you, and you will see that everything is clean for you. \n   \n","Woe to you Pharisees!

You build tombs for the prophets, but it was your fathers who killed them. \n","So you are witnesses consenting to the deeds of your fathers: They killed the prophets, and you build their tombs. \n","Because of this, the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles; some of them they will kill and others they will persecute.’ \n   \n","As a result, this generation will be charged with the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the foundation of the world, \n","from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary.

You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.” \n   \n","As Jesus went on from there, the scribes and Pharisees began to oppose Him bitterly and to ply Him with questions about many things, \n","waiting to catch Him in something He might say. \n"],["In the meantime, a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling one another. Jesus began to speak first to His disciples: “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. \n","There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known. \n","What you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops. \n   \n","I tell you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. \n","But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear the One who, after you have been killed, has authority to throw you into hell.

Then who will own what you have accumulated?’ \n   \n","This is how it will be for anyone who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.” \n   \n","Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear. \n","For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. \n","Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storehouse or barn; yet God feeds them.

Likewise, let no one in the field return for anything he has left behind. \n","Remember Lot’s wife! \n","Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it. \n","I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed: One will be taken and the other left. \n","Two women will be grinding grain together: One will be taken and the other left.” \n   \n"],["Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray at all times and not lose heart: \n","“In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected men. \n","And there was a widow in that town who kept appealing to him, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ \n   \n","For a while he refused, but later he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect men, \n","yet because this widow keeps pestering me, I will give her justice. Then she will stop wearing me out with her perpetual requests.’” \n   \n","And the Lord said, “Listen to the words of the unjust judge. \n","Will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry out to Him day and night? Will He continue to defer their help? \n","I tell you, He will promptly carry out justice on their behalf. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?” \n   \n","To some who trusted in their own righteousness and viewed others with contempt, He also told this parable: \n","“Two men went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. \n","The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, ‘God, I thank You that I am not like the other men—swindlers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. \n","I fast twice a week and pay tithes of all that I acquire.’ \n   \n","But the tax collector stood at a distance, unwilling even to lift up his eyes to heaven. Instead, he beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner!’ \n","I tell you, this man, rather than the Pharisee, went home justified. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” \n   \n","Now people were even bringing their babies to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them. And when the disciples saw this, they rebuked those who brought them. \n   \n","But Jesus called the children to Him and said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. \n","Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” \n   \n","Then a certain ruler asked Him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” \n   \n","“Why do you call Me good?” Jesus replied. “No one is good except God alone. \n","You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother.’ ” \n   \n","“All these I have kept from my youth,” he said. \n   \n","On hearing this, Jesus told him, “You still lack one thing: Sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.” \n   \n","But when the ruler heard this, he became very sad, because he was extremely wealthy. \n   \n","Seeing the man’s sadness, Jesus said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! \n","Indeed, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” \n   \n","Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?” \n   \n","But Jesus said, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.” \n   \n","“Look,” said Peter, “we have left all we had  to follow You.” \n   \n","“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God \n","will fail to receive many times more in this age—and in the age to come, eternal life.” \n   \n","Then Jesus took the Twelve aside and said to them, “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything the prophets have written about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. \n","He will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon. \n","They will flog Him and kill Him, and on the third day He will rise again.” \n   \n","But the disciples did not understand any of these things. The meaning was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend what He was saying. \n   \n","As Jesus drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting beside the road, begging. \n","When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. \n   \n","“Jesus of Nazareth is passing by,” they told him. \n   \n","So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” \n   \n","Those who led the way admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” \n   \n","Jesus stopped and directed that the man be brought to Him. When he had been brought near, Jesus asked him, \n","“What do you want Me to do for you?” \n  “Lord,” he said, “let me see again.” \n   \n","“Receive your sight!” Jesus replied. “Your faith has healed you.” \n","Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, glorifying God. And all the people who saw this gave praise to God. \n"],["Then Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. \n","And there was a man named Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector, who was very wealthy. \n","He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not see over the crowd because he was small in stature. \n","So he ran on ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Him, since Jesus was about to pass that way. \n   \n","When Jesus came to that place, He looked up and said, “Zacchaeus, hurry down, for I must stay at your house today.” \n   \n","So Zacchaeus hurried down and welcomed Him joyfully. \n","And all who saw this began to grumble, saying, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinful man!” \n   \n","But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone, I will repay it fourfold.” \n   \n","Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of Abraham. \n","For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.” \n   \n","While the people were listening to this, Jesus proceeded to tell them a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they thought the kingdom of God would appear imminently. \n","So He said, “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to lay claim to his kingship and then return. \n","Beforehand, he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Conduct business with this until I return,’ he said. \n   \n","But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We do not want this man to rule over us.’ \n   \n","When he returned from procuring his kingship, he summoned the servants to whom he had given the money, to find out what each one had earned. \n   \n","The first servant came forward and said, ‘Master, your mina has produced ten more minas.’ \n   \n","His master replied, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, you shall have authority over ten cities.’ \n   \n","The second servant came and said, ‘Master, your mina has made five minas.’ \n   \n","And to this one he said, ‘You shall have authority over five cities.’ \n   \n","Then another servant came and said, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I have laid away in a piece of cloth. \n","For I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man. You withdraw what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.’ \n   \n","His master replied, ‘You wicked servant, I will judge you by your own words. So you knew that I am a harsh man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? \n","Why then did you not deposit my money in the bank, and upon my return I could have collected it with interest?’ \n   \n","Then he told those standing by, ‘Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’ \n   \n","‘Master,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’ \n   \n","He replied, ‘I tell you that everyone who has will be given more; but the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. \n","And these enemies of mine who were unwilling for me to rule over them, bring them here and slay them in front of me.’” \n   \n","After Jesus had said this, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. \n   \n","As He approached Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, He sent out two of His disciples, \n","saying, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. \n","If anyone asks, ‘Why are you untying it?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it.’” \n   \n","So those who were sent went out and found it just as Jesus had told them. \n","As they were untying the colt, its owners asked, “Why are you untying the colt?” \n   \n","“The Lord needs it,” they answered. \n","Then they led the colt to Jesus, threw their cloaks over it, and put Jesus on it. \n   \n","As He rode along, the people spread their cloaks on the road. \n","And as He approached the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of disciples began to praise God joyfully in a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen: \n   \n","“Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!” \n  “Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!” \n   \n","But some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples!” \n   \n","“I tell you,” He answered, “if they remain silent, the very stones will cry out.” \n   \n","As Jesus approached Jerusalem and saw the city, He wept over it \n","and said, “If only you had known on this day what would bring you peace! But now it is hidden from your eyes. \n","For the days will come upon you when your enemies will barricade you and surround you and hem you in on every side. \n","They will level you to the ground—you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God. ” \n   \n","Then Jesus entered the temple courts  and began to drive out those who were selling there. \n","He declared to them, “It is written: ‘My house will be a house of prayer.’  But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’ ” \n   \n","Jesus was teaching at the temple every day, but the chief priests, scribes, and leaders of the people were intent on killing Him. \n","Yet they could not find a way to do so, because all the people hung on His words. \n"],["One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts  and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and scribes, together with the elders, came up to Him. \n","“Tell us,” they said, “by what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?” \n   \n","“I will also ask you a question,” Jesus replied. “Tell Me: \n","John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?” \n   \n","They deliberated among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why did you not believe him?’ \n","But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.” \n   \n","So they answered that they did not know where it was from. \n   \n","And Jesus replied, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.” \n   \n","Then He proceeded to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to some tenants, and went away for a long time. \n","At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed. \n   \n","So he sent another servant, but they beat him and treated him shamefully, sending him away empty-handed. \n   \n","Then he sent a third, but they wounded him and threw him out. \n   \n","‘What shall I do?’ asked the owner of the vineyard. ‘I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him.’ \n   \n","But when the tenants saw the son, they discussed it among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ \n","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. \n  What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? \n","He will come and kill those tenants, and will give the vineyard to others.” \n  And when the people heard this, they said, “May such a thing never happen!” \n   \n","But Jesus looked directly at them and said, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written: \n  ‘The stone the builders rejected \n has become the cornerstone’ ? \n   \n","Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.” \n   \n","When the scribes and chief priests realized that Jesus had spoken this parable against them, they sought to arrest Him that very hour. But they were afraid of the people. \n   \n","So they watched Him closely and sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They were hoping to catch Him in His words in order to hand Him over to the rule and authority of the governor. \n","“Teacher,” they inquired, “we know that You speak and teach correctly. You show no partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. \n","Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” \n   \n","But Jesus saw through their duplicity and said to them, \n","“Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?” \n  “Caesar’s,” they answered. \n   \n","So Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” \n   \n","And they were unable to trap Him in His words before the people; and amazed at His answer, they fell silent. \n   \n","Then some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to question Him. \n","“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up offspring for him. \n","Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a wife, but died childless. \n","Then the second  \n","and the third married the widow, and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children. \n","And last of all, the woman died. \n","So then, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage. \n","But those who are considered worthy to share in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage. \n","In fact, they can no longer die, because they are like the angels. And since they are sons of the resurrection, they are sons of God. \n   \n","Even Moses demonstrates that the dead are raised, in the passage about the burning bush. For he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ \n","He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive.” \n   \n","Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, You have spoken well!” \n","And they did not dare to question Him any further. \n   \n","Then Jesus declared, “How can it be said that the Christ is the Son of David? \n","For David himself says in the book of Psalms: \n  ‘The Lord said to my Lord, \n “Sit at My right hand \n  \n","until I make Your enemies \n a footstool for Your feet.”’ \n   \n","Thus David calls Him ‘Lord.’ So how can He be David’s son?” \n   \n","In the hearing of all the people, Jesus said to His disciples, \n","“Beware of the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, and they love the greetings in the marketplaces, the chief seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets. \n","They defraud widows of their houses, and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater condemnation.” \n"],["Then Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury, \n","and He saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. \n   \n","“Truly I tell you,” He said, “this poor widow has put in more than all the others. \n","For they all contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.” \n   \n","As some of the disciples were remarking how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and consecrated gifts, Jesus said, \n","“As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.” \n   \n","“Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “See to it that you are not deceived. For many will come in My name, claiming, ‘I am He,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them. \n","When you hear of wars and rebellions, do not be alarmed. These things must happen first, but the end is not imminent.” \n   \n","Then He told them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. \n","There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, along with fearful sights and great signs from heaven. \n   \n","But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. On account of My name they will deliver you to the synagogues and prisons, and they will bring you before kings and governors. \n","This will be your opportunity to serve as witnesses. \n","So make up your mind not to worry beforehand how to defend yourselves. \n","For I will give you speech and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. \n   \n","You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you will be put to death. \n","And you will be hated by everyone because of My name. \n","Yet not even a hair of your head will perish. \n","By your patient endurance you will gain your souls. \n   \n","But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know that her desolation is near. \n","Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country stay out of the city. \n","For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written. \n   \n","How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! For there will be great distress upon the land and wrath against this people. \n","They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations. And Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. \n   \n","There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among the nations, bewildered by the roaring of the sea and the surging of the waves. \n","Men will faint from fear and anxiety over what is coming upon the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. \n","At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. \n","When these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.” \n   \n","Then Jesus told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees. \n","When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. \n","So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. \n","Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened. \n","Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away. \n   \n","But watch yourselves, or your hearts will be weighed down by dissipation, drunkenness, and the worries of life—and that day will spring upon you suddenly like a snare. \n","For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of all the earth. \n","So keep watch at all times, and pray that you may have the strength to escape all that is about to happen and to stand before the Son of Man.” \n   \n","Every day Jesus taught at the temple, but every evening He went out to spend the night on the Mount of Olives. \n","And early in the morning all the people would come to hear Him at the temple. \n"],["Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, \n","and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to put Jesus to death; for they feared the people. \n   \n","Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve. \n","And Judas went to discuss with the chief priests and temple officers how he might betray Jesus to them. \n","They were delighted and agreed to give him money. \n","Judas consented, and began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a crowd. \n   \n","Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed. \n","Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare for us to eat the Passover.” \n   \n","“Where do You want us to prepare it?” they asked. \n   \n","He answered, “When you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters, \n","and say to the owner of that house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’ \n","And he will show you a large upper room, already furnished. Make preparations there.” \n   \n","So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them. And they prepared the Passover. \n   \n","When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles. \n","And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering. \n","For I tell you that I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” \n   \n","After taking the cup, He gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves. \n","For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.” \n   \n","And He took the bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body, given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” \n   \n","In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you. \n   \n","Look! The hand of My betrayer is with Mine on the table. \n","Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.” \n   \n","Then they began to question among themselves which of them was going to do this. \n   \n","A dispute also arose among the disciples as to which of them would be considered the greatest. \n","So Jesus declared, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them call themselves benefactors. \n","But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves. \n","For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves. \n   \n","You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials. \n","And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father has bestowed one on Me, \n","so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. \n   \n","Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat. \n","But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” \n   \n","“Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.” \n   \n","But Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.” \n   \n","Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” \n  “Nothing,” they answered. \n   \n","“Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one. \n","For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.” \n   \n","So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” \n  “That is enough,” He answered. \n   \n","Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him. \n","When He came to the place, He told them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.” \n   \n","And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed, \n","“Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.” \n   \n","Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him. \n","And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. \n   \n","When Jesus rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. \n","“Why are you sleeping?” He asked. “Get up and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.” \n   \n","While He was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss Him. \n","But Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” \n   \n","Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” \n","And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. \n   \n","But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him. \n   \n","Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple officers, and elders who had come for Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against an outlaw? \n","Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on Me. But this hour belongs to you and to the power of darkness.” \n   \n","Then they seized Jesus, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance. \n   \n","When those present had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. \n","A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked intently at him. “This man also was with Him,” she said. \n   \n","But Peter denied it. “Woman, I do not know Him,” he said. \n   \n","A short time later, someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” \n  But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” \n   \n","About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.” \n   \n","“Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied. \n  While he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. \n","And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. \n  Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.” \n","And he went outside and wept bitterly. \n   \n","The men who were holding Jesus began to mock Him and beat Him. \n","They blindfolded Him  and kept demanding, “Prophesy! Who hit You?” \n","And they said many other blasphemous things against Him. \n   \n","At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and scribes, met together. They led Jesus into their Sanhedrin  and said, \n","“If You are the Christ, tell us.” \n  Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe. \n","And if I ask you a question, you will not answer. \n","But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.” \n   \n","So they all asked, “Are You then the Son of God?” \n  He replied, “You say that I am.” \n   \n","“Why do we need any more testimony?” they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.” \n"],["Then the whole council rose and led Jesus away to Pilate. \n","And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar, and proclaiming Himself to be Christ, a King.” \n   \n","So Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” \n  “You have said so,” Jesus replied. \n   \n","Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” \n   \n","But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people all over Judea with His teaching. He began in Galilee and has come all the way here.” \n   \n","When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean. \n","And learning that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was in Jerusalem at that time. \n   \n","When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased. He had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see Him perform a miracle. \n","Herod questioned Jesus at great length, but He gave no answer. \n   \n","Meanwhile, the chief priests and scribes stood there, vehemently accusing Him. \n","And even Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked Him. Dressing Him in a fine robe, they sent Him back to Pilate. \n   \n","That day Herod and Pilate became friends; before this time they had been enemies. \n   \n","Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, \n","and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined Him here in your presence and found Him not guilty of your charges against Him. \n","Neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us. As you can see, He has done nothing deserving of death. \n","Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.” \n   \n",null,"But they all cried out in unison: “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!” \n","(Barabbas had been imprisoned for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.) \n   \n","Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed them again, \n","but they kept shouting, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” \n   \n","A third time he said to them, “What evil has this man done? I have found in Him no offense worthy of death. So after I punish Him, I will release Him.” \n   \n","But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices for Jesus to be crucified. And their clamor  prevailed. \n","So Pilate sentenced that their demand be met. \n","As they had requested, he released the one imprisoned for insurrection and murder, and handed Jesus over to their will. \n   \n","As the soldiers led Him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus. \n   \n","A great number of people followed Him, including women who kept mourning and wailing for Him. \n","But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. \n","Look, the days are coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore, and breasts that never nursed!’ \n","At that time \n  ‘they will say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” \n and to the hills, “Cover us!”’ \n   \n","For if men do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?” \n   \n","Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with Jesus. \n   \n","When they came to the place called The Skull, they crucified Him there, along with the criminals, one on His right and the other on His left. \n   \n","Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”  And they divided up His garments by casting lots. \n   \n","The people stood watching, and the rulers sneered at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.” \n   \n","The soldiers also mocked Him and came up to offer Him sour wine. \n","“If You are the King of the Jews,” they said, “save Yourself!” \n   \n","Above Him was posted an inscription: \n  THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. \n   \n","One of the criminals who hung there heaped abuse on Him. “Are You not the Christ?” he said. “Save Yourself and us!” \n   \n","But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same judgment? \n","We are punished justly, for we are receiving what our actions deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.” \n","Then he said, “Jesus, remember me  when You come into Your kingdom!” \n   \n","And Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.” \n   \n","It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour. \n","The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn down the middle. \n   \n","Then Jesus called out in a loud voice, “Father, into Your hands I commit My Spirit.” And when He had said this, He breathed His last. \n   \n","When the centurion saw what had happened, he gave glory to God, saying, “Surely this was a righteous man. ” \n","And when all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts. \n","But all those who knew Jesus, including the women who had followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching these things. \n   \n","Now there was a Council member named Joseph, a good and righteous man, \n","who had not consented to their decision or action. He was from the Judean town of Arimathea, and was waiting for the kingdom of God. \n","He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus. \n","Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had yet been laid. \n","It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was beginning. \n   \n","The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how His body was placed. \n"],["On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared. \n","They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, \n","but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. \n","While they were puzzling over this, suddenly two men in radiant apparel stood beside them. \n   \n","As the women bowed their faces to the ground in terror, the two men asked them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? \n","He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee: \n","‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’” \n   \n","Then they remembered His words. \n","And when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. \n","It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles. \n","But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women. \n   \n","Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. \n   \n","That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles  from Jerusalem. \n","They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. \n","And as they talked and deliberated, Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them. \n","But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. \n   \n","He asked them, “What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?” \n  They stood still, with sadness on their faces. \n","One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?” \n   \n","“What things?” He asked. \n  “The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people. \n","Our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and they crucified Him. \n","But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place. \n   \n","Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, \n","but they did not find His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive. \n","Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did not see.” \n   \n","Then Jesus said to them, “O foolish ones, how slow are your hearts to believe all that the prophets have spoken! \n","Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then to enter His glory?” \n","And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was written in all the Scriptures about Himself. \n   \n","As they approached the village where they were headed, He seemed to be going farther. \n","But they pleaded with Him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.” \n  So He went in to stay with them. \n","While He was reclining at the table with them, He took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to them. \n","Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus—and He disappeared from their sight. \n   \n","They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us as He spoke with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?” \n","And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. \n  There they found the Eleven and those with them, gathered together \n","and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon!” \n   \n","Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how they had recognized Jesus in the breaking of the bread. \n   \n","While they were describing these events, Jesus Himself stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” \n","But they were startled and frightened, thinking they had seen a spirit. \n   \n","“Why are you troubled,” Jesus asked, “and why do doubts arise in your hearts? \n","Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself. Touch Me and see—for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.” \n","And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet. \n   \n","While they were still in disbelief because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” \n","So they gave Him a piece of broiled fish, \n","and He took it and ate it in front of them. \n   \n","Jesus said to them, “These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.” \n","Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures. \n   \n","And He told them, “This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, \n","and in His name repentance and forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem. \n","You are witnesses of these things. \n   \n","And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you. But remain in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.” \n   \n","When Jesus had led them out as far as Bethany, He lifted up His hands and blessed them. \n","While He was blessing them, He left them and was carried up into heaven. \n","And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, \n","praising God continually in the temple. "]],"John":[["In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. \n","He was with God in the beginning. \n","Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made. \n","In Him was life, and that life was the light of men. \n","The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome  it. \n   \n","There came a man who was sent from God. His name was John. \n","He came as a witness to testify about the Light, so that through him everyone might believe. \n","He himself was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light. \n   \n","The true Light who gives light to every man was coming into the world. \n","He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him. \n","He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. \n","But to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God—\n","children born not of blood, nor of the desire or will of man, but born of God. \n   \n","The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.  We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son  from the Father, full of grace and truth. \n   \n","John testified concerning Him. He cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’” \n   \n","From His fullness we have all received grace upon grace. \n","For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. \n","No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and   is at the Father’s side, has made Him known. \n   \n","And this was John’s testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?” \n","He did not refuse to confess, but openly declared, “I am not the Christ.” \n   \n","“Then who are you?” they inquired. “Are you Elijah?” \n  He said, “I am not.” \n  “Are you the Prophet?” \n  He answered, “No.” \n   \n","So they said to him, “Who are you? We need an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” \n   \n","John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet: \n  “I am a voice of one calling in the wilderness, \n ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’” \n   \n","Then the Pharisees who had been sent \n","asked him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” \n   \n","“I baptize with  water,” John replied, “but among you stands One you do not know. \n","He is the One who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.” \n   \n","All this happened at Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing. \n   \n","The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! \n","This is He of whom I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’ \n","I myself did not know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that He might be revealed to Israel.” \n   \n","Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and resting on Him. \n","I myself did not know Him, but the One who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is He who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ \n","I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God. ” \n   \n","The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. \n","When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” \n","And when the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. \n   \n","Jesus turned and saw them following. “What do you want?” He asked. \n  They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are You staying?” \n   \n","“Come and see,” He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and spent that day with Him. It was about the tenth hour. \n   \n","Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John’s testimony and followed Jesus. \n","He first found his brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated as Christ). \n   \n","Andrew brought him to Jesus, who looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated as Peter). \n   \n","The next day Jesus decided to set out for Galilee. Finding Philip, He told him, “Follow Me.” \n","Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter. \n   \n","Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law, the One the prophets foretold—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” \n   \n","“Can anything good come from Nazareth?” Nathanael asked. \n  “Come and see,” said Philip. \n   \n","When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, He said of him, “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit.” \n   \n","“How do You know me?” Nathanael asked. \n  Jesus replied, “Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.” \n   \n","“Rabbi,” Nathanael answered, “You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” \n   \n","Jesus said to him, “Do you believe just because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.” \n","Then He declared, “Truly, truly, I tell you, you will all see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.” \n"],["On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, \n","and Jesus and His disciples had also been invited to the wedding. \n","When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to Him, “They have no more wine.” \n   \n","“Woman, why does this concern us?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.” \n   \n","His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.” \n   \n","Now six stone water jars had been set there for the Jewish rites of purification. Each could hold from twenty to thirty gallons. \n","Jesus told the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” \n  So they filled them to the brim. \n   \n","“Now draw some out,” He said, “and take it to the master of the banquet.” \n  They did so, \n","and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not know where it was from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside \n","and said, “Everyone serves the fine wine first, and then the cheap wine after the guests are drunk. But you have saved the fine wine until now!” \n   \n","Jesus performed this, the first of His signs, at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him. \n   \n","After this, He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers and His disciples, and they stayed there a few days. \n   \n","When the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. \n","In the temple courts  He found men selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and money changers seated at their tables. \n","So He made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle. He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. \n","To those selling doves He said, “Get these out of here! How dare you turn My Father’s house into a marketplace!” \n   \n","His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for Your house will consume Me.” \n   \n","On account of this, the Jews demanded, “What sign can You show us to prove Your authority to do these things?” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.” \n   \n","“This temple took forty-six years to build,” the Jews replied, “and You are going to raise it up in three days?” \n   \n","But Jesus was speaking about the temple of His body. \n","After He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken. \n   \n","While He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the signs He was doing and believed in His name. \n","But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew them all. \n","He did not need any testimony about man, for He knew what was in a man. \n"],["Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. \n","He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him.” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. ” \n   \n","“How can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time to be born?” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. \n","Flesh is born of flesh, but spirit is born of the Spirit. \n","Do not be amazed that I said, ‘You  must be born again.’ \n","The wind blows where it wishes. You hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.” \n   \n","“How can this be?” Nicodemus asked. \n   \n","“You are Israel’s teacher,” said Jesus, “and you do not understand these things? \n","Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, and yet you people do not accept our testimony. \n   \n","If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? \n","No one has ascended into heaven except the One who descended from heaven—the Son of Man. \n","Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, \n","that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life. \n   \n","For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only  Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. \n","For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. \n","Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. \n   \n","And this is the verdict: The Light has come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the Light because their deeds were evil. \n","Everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come into the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. \n","But whoever practices the truth comes into the Light, so that it may be seen clearly that what he has done has been accomplished in God.” \n   \n","After this, Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, where He spent some time with them and baptized. \n   \n","Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because the water was plentiful there, and people kept coming to be baptized. \n","(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.) \n   \n","Then a dispute arose between John’s disciples and a certain Jew  over the issue of ceremonial washing. \n","So John’s disciples came to him and said, “Look, Rabbi, the One who was with you beyond the Jordan, the One you testified about—He is baptizing, and everyone is going to Him.” \n   \n","John replied, “A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. \n","You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but am sent ahead of Him.’ \n","The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom stands and listens for him, and is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. \n","He must increase; I must decrease. \n   \n","The One who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth. The One who comes from heaven is above all. \n","He testifies to what He has seen and heard, yet no one accepts His testimony. \n","Whoever accepts His testimony has certified that God is truthful. \n","For the One whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. \n   \n","The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in His hands. \n","Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. Whoever rejects the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him.” \n"],["When Jesus realized that the Pharisees were aware He  was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John \n","(although it was not Jesus who baptized, but His disciples), \n","He left Judea and returned to Galilee. \n   \n","Now He had to pass through Samaria. \n","So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. \n","Since Jacob’s well was there, Jesus, weary from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. \n   \n","When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” \n","(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) \n   \n","“You are a Jew,” said the woman. “How can You ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) \n   \n","Jesus answered, “If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.” \n   \n","“Sir,” the woman replied, “You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where then will You get this living water? \n","Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?” \n   \n","Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again. \n","But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a fount of water springing up to eternal life.” \n   \n","The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.” \n   \n","Jesus told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.” \n   \n","“I have no husband,” the woman replied. \n  Jesus said to her, “You are correct to say that you have no husband. \n","In fact, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. You have spoken truthfully.” \n   \n","“Sir,” the woman said, “I see that You are a prophet. \n","Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where one must worship is in Jerusalem.” \n   \n","“Believe Me, woman,” Jesus replied, “a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. \n","You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. \n","But a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father is seeking such as these to worship Him. \n","God is Spirit, and His worshipers must worship Him in spirit and in truth.” \n   \n","The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When He comes, He will explain everything to us.” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “I who speak to you am He.” \n   \n","Just then His disciples returned and were surprised that He was speaking with a woman. But no one asked Him, “What do You want from her?” or “Why are You talking with her?” \n   \n","Then the woman left her water jar, went back into the town, and said to the people, \n","“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?” \n","So they left the town and made their way toward Jesus. \n   \n","Meanwhile the disciples urged Him, “Rabbi, eat something.” \n   \n","But He told them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” \n   \n","So the disciples asked one another, “Could someone have brought Him food?” \n   \n","Jesus explained, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work. \n","Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest’? I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are ripe  for harvest. \n   \n","Already the reaper draws his wages and gathers a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together. \n","For in this case the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true. \n","I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the hard work, and now you have taken up their labor.” \n   \n","Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.” \n","So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to stay with them, and He stayed two days. \n   \n","And many more believed because of His message. \n","They said to the woman, “We now believe not only because of your words; we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man truly is the Savior of the world.” \n   \n","After two days, Jesus left for Galilee. \n","Now He Himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown. \n","Yet when He arrived, the Galileans welcomed Him. They had seen all the great things He had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had gone there as well. \n   \n","So once again He came to Cana in Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. \n","When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die. \n   \n","Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.” \n   \n","“Sir,” the official said, “come down before my child dies.” \n   \n","“Go,” said Jesus. “Your son will live.” \n  The man took Jesus at His word and departed. \n","And while he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive. \n   \n","So he inquired as to the hour when his son had recovered, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour. ” \n   \n","Then the father realized that this was the very hour in which Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” And he and all his household believed. \n   \n","This was now the second sign that Jesus performed after coming from Judea into Galilee. \n"],["Some time later there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. \n   \n","Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool with five covered colonnades, which in Hebrew   is called Bethesda. \n","On these walkways   lay a great number of the sick, the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed. \n   \n",null,"One man there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. \n","When Jesus saw him lying there and realized that he had spent a long time in this condition, He asked him, “Do you want to get well?” \n   \n","“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am on my way, someone else goes in before me.” \n   \n","Then Jesus told him, “Get up, pick up your mat, and walk.” \n   \n","Immediately the man was made well, and he picked up his mat and began to walk. \n  Now this happened on the Sabbath day, \n","so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath! It is unlawful for you to carry your mat.” \n   \n","But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’” \n   \n","“Who is this man who told you to pick it up and walk?” they asked. \n   \n","But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while the crowd was there. \n   \n","Afterward, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him, “See, you have been made well. Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you.” \n   \n","And the man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. \n   \n","Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews began to persecute Him. \n","But Jesus answered them, “To this very day My Father is at His work, and I too am working.” \n   \n","Because of this, the Jews tried all the harder to kill Him. Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God. \n   \n","So Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, unless He sees the Father doing it. For whatever the Father does, the Son also does. \n","The Father loves the Son and shows Him all He does. And to your amazement, He will show Him even greater works than these. \n","For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wishes. \n   \n","Furthermore, the Father judges no one, but has assigned all judgment to the Son, \n","so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. \n   \n","Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and will not come under judgment. Indeed, he has crossed over from death to life. \n   \n","Truly, truly, I tell you, the hour is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. \n","For as the Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself. \n","And He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man. \n   \n","Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice \n","and come out—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment. \n   \n","I can do nothing by Myself; I judge only as I hear. And My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me. \n   \n","If I testify about Myself, My testimony is not valid. \n","There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that His testimony about Me is valid. \n   \n","You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth. \n","Even though I do not accept human testimony, I say these things so that you may be saved. \n   \n","John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you were willing for a season to bask in his light. \n","But I have testimony more substantial than that of John. For the works that the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very works I am doing—testify about Me that the Father has sent Me. \n","And the Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form, \n","nor does His word abide in you, because you do not believe the One He sent. \n   \n","You pore over the Scriptures because you presume that by them you possess eternal life. These are the very words that testify about Me, \n","yet you refuse to come to Me to have life. \n   \n","I do not accept glory from men, \n","but I know you, that you do not have the love of God within you. \n","I have come in My Father’s name, and you have not received Me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will receive him. \n","How can you believe if you accept glory from one another, yet do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? \n   \n","Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, in whom you have put your hope. \n","If you had believed Moses, you would believe Me, because he wrote about Me. \n"],["After this, Jesus crossed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias). \n","A large crowd followed Him because they saw the signs He was performing on the sick. \n","Then Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with His disciples. \n   \n","Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near. \n","When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward Him, He said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?” \n","But He was asking this to test him, for He knew what He was about to do. \n   \n","Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii  would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece.” \n   \n","One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him, \n","“Here is a boy with five barley loaves and two small fish. But what difference will these make among so many?” \n   \n","“Have the people sit down,” Jesus said. Now there was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, about five thousand of them. \n   \n","Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. \n   \n","And when everyone was full, He said to His disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left over, so that nothing will be wasted.” \n   \n","So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. \n   \n","When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed, they began to say, “Truly this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.” \n   \n","Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and make Him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by Himself. \n   \n","When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, \n","got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was already dark, and Jesus had not yet gone out to them. \n","A strong wind was blowing, and the sea grew agitated. \n   \n","When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the sea—and they were terrified. \n","But Jesus spoke up: “It is I; do not be afraid.” \n","Then they were willing to take Him into the boat, and at once the boat reached the shore where they were heading. \n   \n","The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with His disciples, but they had gone away alone. \n","However, some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. \n","So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for Him. \n","When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it is not because you saw these signs that you are looking for Me, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. \n","Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on Him God the Father has placed His seal of approval.” \n   \n","Then they inquired, “What must we do to perform the works of God?” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “The work of God is this: to believe in the One He has sent.” \n   \n","So they asked Him, “What sign then will You perform, so that we may see it and believe You? What will You do? \n","Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ ” \n   \n","Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. \n","For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” \n   \n","“Sir,” they said, “give us this bread at all times.” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and whoever believes in Me will never thirst. \n","But as I stated, you have seen Me and still you do not believe. \n   \n","Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never drive away. \n","For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but to do the will of Him who sent Me. \n   \n","And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that I shall lose none of those He has given Me, but raise them up at the last day. \n","For it is My Father’s will that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.” \n   \n","At this, the Jews began to grumble about Jesus because He had said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” \n","They were asking, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then can He say, ‘I have come down from heaven?’” \n   \n","“Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus replied. \n","“No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. \n","It is written in the Prophets: ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from Him comes to Me—\n","not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God; only He has seen the Father. \n   \n","Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes has eternal life. \n","I am the bread of life. \n","Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. \n","This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die. \n","I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And this bread, which I will give for the life of the world, is My flesh.” \n   \n","At this, the Jews began to argue among themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?” \n   \n","So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, you have no life in you. \n","Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. \n","For My flesh is real food, and My blood is real drink. \n   \n","Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him. \n","Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on Me will live because of Me. \n","This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your fathers, who ate the manna and died, the one who eats this bread will live forever.” \n   \n","Jesus said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. \n","On hearing it, many of His disciples said, “This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?” \n   \n","Aware that His disciples were grumbling about this teaching, Jesus asked them, “Does this offend you? \n","Then what will happen if you see the Son of Man ascend to where He was before? \n   \n","The Spirit gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. \n","However, there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray Him.) \n   \n","Then Jesus said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless the Father has granted it to him.” \n   \n","From that time on many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him. \n   \n","So Jesus asked the Twelve, “Do you want to leave too?” \n   \n","Simon Peter replied, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life. \n","We believe and know that You are the Holy One of God. ” \n   \n","Jesus answered them, “Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!” \n","He was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For although Judas was one of the Twelve, he was later to betray Jesus. \n"],["After this, Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. He did not want to travel in Judea, because the Jews there were trying to kill Him. \n","However, the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles  was near. \n","So Jesus’ brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go to Judea, so that Your disciples there may see the works You are doing. \n","For no one who wants to be known publicly acts in secret. Since You are doing these things, show Yourself to the world.” \n","For even His own brothers did not believe in Him. \n   \n","Therefore Jesus told them, “Although your time is always at hand, My time has not yet come. \n","The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify that its works are evil. \n","Go up to the feast on your own. I am not  going up to this feast, because My time has not yet come.” \n   \n","Having said this, Jesus remained in Galilee. \n","But after His brothers had gone up to the feast, He also went—not publicly, but in secret. \n   \n","So the Jews were looking for Him at the feast and asking, “Where is He?” \n   \n","Many in the crowds were whispering about Him. Some said, “He is a good man.” \n  But others replied, “No, He deceives the people.” \n   \n","Yet no one would speak publicly about Him for fear of the Jews. \n   \n","About halfway through the feast, Jesus went up to the temple courts  and began to teach. \n","The Jews were amazed and asked, “How did this man attain such learning without having studied?” \n   \n","“My teaching is not My own,” Jesus replied. “It comes from Him who sent Me. \n","If anyone desires to do His will, he will know whether My teaching is from God or whether I speak on My own. \n","He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is a man of truth; in Him there is no falsehood. \n","Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps it. Why are you trying to kill Me?” \n   \n","“You have a demon,” the crowd replied. “Who is trying to kill You?” \n   \n","Jesus answered them, “I did one miracle, and you are all amazed. \n","But because Moses gave you circumcision, you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath (not that it is from Moses, but from the patriarchs.) \n","If a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses will not be broken, why are you angry with Me for making the whole man well on the Sabbath? \n","Stop judging by outward appearances, and start judging justly.” \n   \n","Then some of the people of Jerusalem began to say, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill? \n","Yet here He is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying anything to Him. Have the rulers truly recognized that this is the Christ? \n","But we know where this man is from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where He is from.” \n   \n","Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, “You know Me, and you know where I am from. I have not come of My own accord, but He who sent Me is true. You do not know Him, \n","but I know Him, because I am from Him and He sent Me.” \n   \n","So they tried to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. \n","Many in the crowd, however, believed in Him and said, “When the Christ comes, will He perform more signs than this man?” \n   \n","When the Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus, they and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him. \n","So Jesus said, “I am with you only a little while longer, and then I am going to the One who sent Me. \n","You will look for Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.” \n   \n","At this, the Jews said to one another, “Where does He intend to go that we will not find Him? Will He go where the Jews are dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? \n","What does He mean by saying, ‘You will look for Me, but you will not find Me,’ and, ‘Where I am, you cannot come’?” \n   \n","On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and called out in a loud voice, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. \n","Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said: ‘Streams of living water will flow from within him.’” \n","He was speaking about the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were later to receive. For the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. \n   \n","On hearing these words, some of the people said, “This is truly the Prophet.” \n   \n","Others declared, “This is the Christ.” \n  But still others asked, “How can the Christ come from Galilee? \n","Doesn’t the Scripture say that the Christ will come from the line of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived? ” \n   \n","So there was division in the crowd because of Jesus. \n","Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him. \n   \n","Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring Him in?” \n   \n","“Never has anyone spoken like this man!” the officers answered. \n   \n","“Have you also been deceived?” replied the Pharisees. \n","“Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him? \n","But this crowd that does not know the law, they are under a curse.” \n   \n","Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who himself was one of them, asked, \n","“Does our law convict a man without first hearing from him to determine what he has done?” \n   \n","“Aren’t you also from Galilee?” they replied. “Look into it, and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.” \n   \n","Then each went to his own home. \n"],["But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. \n   \n","Early in the morning He went back into the temple courts. All the people came to Him, and He sat down to teach them. \n","The scribes and Pharisees, however, brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before them \n","and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. \n","In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do You say?” \n   \n","They said this to test Him, in order to have a basis for accusing Him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with His finger. \n   \n","When they continued to question Him, He straightened up and said to them, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.” \n","And again He bent down and wrote on the ground. \n   \n","When they heard this, they began to go away one by one, beginning with the older ones, until only Jesus was left, with the woman standing there. \n","Then Jesus straightened up   and asked her, “Woman, where are your accusers? Has no one condemned you?” \n   \n","“No one, Lord,” she answered. \n  “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Now go and sin no more.” \n   \n","Once again, Jesus spoke to the people and said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.” \n   \n","So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going. \n","You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one. \n","But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone; I am with the Father who sent Me. \n","Even in your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid. \n","I am One who testifies about Myself, and the Father, who sent Me, also testifies about Me.” \n   \n","“Where is Your Father?” they asked Him. \n  “You do not know Me or My Father,” Jesus answered. “If you knew Me, you would know My Father as well.” \n   \n","He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts, near the treasury. Yet no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come. \n   \n","Again He said to them, “I am going away, and you will look for Me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.” \n   \n","So the Jews began to ask, “Will He kill Himself, since He says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?” \n   \n","Then He told them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. \n","That is why I told you that you would die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.” \n   \n","“Who are You?” they asked. \n  “Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,” Jesus replied. \n","“I have much to say about you and much to judge. But the One who sent Me is truthful, and what I have heard from Him, I tell the world.” \n   \n","They did not understand that He was telling them about the Father. \n","So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on My own, but speak exactly what the Father has taught Me. \n","He who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what pleases Him.” \n   \n","As Jesus spoke these things, many believed in Him. \n","So He said to the Jews who had believed Him, “If you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples. \n","Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” \n   \n","“We are Abraham’s descendants,” they answered. “We have never been slaves to anyone. How can You say we will be set free?” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. \n","A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son belongs to it forever. \n","So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. \n   \n","I know you are Abraham’s descendants, but you are trying to kill Me because My word has no place within you. \n","I speak of what I have seen in the presence of the Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.” \n   \n","“Abraham is our father,” they replied. \n  “If you were children of Abraham,” said Jesus, “you would do the works of Abraham. \n","But now you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing. \n","You are doing the works of your father.” \n  “We are not illegitimate children,” they declared. “Our only Father is God Himself.” \n   \n","Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on My own, but He sent Me. \n   \n","Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept My message. \n","You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, refusing to uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, because he is a liar and the father of lies. \n","But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me! \n   \n","Which of you can prove Me guilty of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe Me? \n","Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.” \n   \n","The Jews answered Him, “Are we not right to say that You are a Samaritan and You have a demon?” \n   \n","“I do not have a demon,” Jesus replied, “but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. \n","I do not seek My own glory. There is One who seeks it, and He is the Judge. \n","Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.” \n   \n","“Now we know that You have a demon!” declared the Jews. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet You say that anyone who keeps Your word will never taste death. \n","Are You greater than our father Abraham? He died, as did the prophets. Who do You claim to be?” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “If I glorify Myself, My glory means nothing. The One who glorifies Me is My Father, of whom you say ‘He is our  God.’ \n","You do not know Him, but I know Him. If I said I did not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know Him, and I keep His word. \n","Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see My day. He saw it and was glad.” \n   \n","Then the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and You have seen Abraham?” \n   \n","“Truly, truly, I tell you,” Jesus declared, “before Abraham was born, I am! ” \n   \n","At this, they picked up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple area. \n"],["Now as Jesus was passing by, He saw a man blind from birth, \n","and His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God would be displayed in him. \n","While it is daytime, we must do  the works of Him who sent Me. Night is coming, when no one can work. \n","While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” \n   \n","When Jesus had said this, He spit on the ground, made some mud, and applied it to the man’s eyes. \n","Then He told him, “Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came back seeing. \n   \n","At this, his neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging began to ask, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?” \n   \n","Some claimed that he was, but others said, “No, he just looks like him.” \n  But the man kept saying, “I am the one.” \n   \n","“How then were your eyes opened?” they asked. \n   \n","He answered, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and anointed my eyes, and He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and received my sight.” \n   \n","“Where is He?” they asked. \n  “I do not know,” he answered. \n   \n","They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. \n","Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened his eyes was a Sabbath. \n","So the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. \n  The man answered, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.” \n   \n","Because of this, some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for He does not keep the Sabbath.” \n  But others said, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” \n  And there was division among them. \n","So once again they asked the man who had been blind, “What do you say about Him, since it was your eyes He opened?” \n  “He is a prophet,” the man replied. \n   \n","The Jews still did not believe that the man had been blind and had received his sight until they summoned his parents \n","and asked, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? So how is it that he can now see?” \n   \n","His parents answered, “We know he is our son, and we know he was born blind. \n","But how he can now see or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.” \n   \n","His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already determined that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Christ would be put out of the synagogue. \n","That was why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.” \n   \n","So a second time they called for the man who had been blind and said, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.” \n   \n","He answered, “Whether He is a sinner I do not know. There is one thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see!” \n   \n","“What did He do to you?” they asked. “How did He open your eyes?” \n   \n","He replied, “I already told you, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?” \n   \n","Then they heaped insults on him and said, “You are His disciple; we are disciples of Moses. \n","We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.” \n   \n","“That is remarkable indeed!” the man said. “You do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes. \n","We know that God does not listen to sinners, but He does listen to the one who worships Him and does His will. \n","Never before has anyone heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. \n","If this man were not from God, He could do no such thing.” \n   \n","They replied, “You were born in utter sin, and you are instructing us?” And they threw him out. \n   \n","When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, He found the man and said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man  ?” \n   \n","“Who is He, Sir?” he replied. “Tell me so that I may believe in Him.” \n   \n","“You have already seen Him,” Jesus answered. “He is the One speaking with you.” \n   \n","“Lord, I believe,” he said. And he worshiped Jesus. \n   \n","Then Jesus declared, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind may see and those who see may become blind.” \n   \n","Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard this, and they asked Him, “Are we blind too?” \n   \n","“If you were blind,” Jesus replied, “you would not be guilty of sin. But since you claim you can see, your guilt remains.” \n"],["“Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the gate, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber. \n","But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. \n","The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen for his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. \n   \n","When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. \n","But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will flee from him because they do not recognize his voice.” \n   \n","Jesus spoke to them using this illustration, but they did not understand what He was telling them. \n","So He said to them again, “Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. \n","All who came before Me  were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. \n","I am the gate. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture. \n","The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness. \n   \n","I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. \n","The hired hand is not the shepherd, and the sheep are not his own. When he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf pounces on them and scatters the flock. \n","The man runs away because he is a hired servant and is unconcerned for the sheep. \n   \n","I am the good shepherd. I know My sheep and My sheep know Me, \n","just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep. \n","I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them in as well, and they will listen to My voice. Then there will be one flock and one shepherd. \n   \n","The reason the Father loves Me is that I lay down My life in order to take it up again. \n","No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from My Father.” \n   \n","Again there was division among the Jews because of Jesus’ message. \n","Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and insane. Why would you listen to Him?” \n   \n","But others replied, “These are not the words of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” \n   \n","At that time the Feast of Dedication  took place in Jerusalem. It was winter, \n","and Jesus was walking in the temple courts  in Solomon’s Colonnade. \n","So the Jews gathered around Him and demanded, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.” \n   \n","“I already told you,” Jesus replied, “but you did not believe. The works I do in My Father’s name testify on My behalf. \n","But because you are not My sheep, you refuse to believe. \n","My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me. \n","I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them out of My hand. \n","My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand. \n","I and the Father are one.” \n   \n","At this, the Jews again picked up stones to stone Him. \n","But Jesus responded, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone Me?” \n   \n","“We are not stoning You for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because You, who are a man, declare Yourself to be God.” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “Is it not written in your Law: ‘I have said you are gods’ ? \n","If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be broken—\n","then what about the One whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world? How then can you accuse Me of blasphemy for stating that I am the Son of God? \n   \n","If I am not doing the works of My Father, then do not believe Me. \n","But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works themselves, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.” \n   \n","At this, they tried again to seize Him, but He escaped their grasp. \n   \n","Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had first been baptizing, and He stayed there. \n","Many came to Him and said, “Although John never performed a sign, everything he said about this man was true.” \n","And many in that place believed in Jesus. \n"],["At this time a man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. \n","(Mary, whose brother Lazarus was sick, was to anoint the Lord with perfume and wipe His feet  with her hair.) \n","So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one You love is sick.” \n   \n","When Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.” \n   \n","Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. \n","So on hearing that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two days, \n","and then He said to the disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.” \n   \n","“Rabbi,” they replied, “the Jews just tried to stone You, and You are going back there?” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If anyone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world. \n","But if anyone walks at night, he will stumble, because he has no light.” \n   \n","After He had said this, He told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.” \n   \n","His disciples replied, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get better.” \n","They thought that Jesus was talking about actual sleep, but He was speaking about the death of Lazarus. \n   \n","So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead, \n","and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” \n   \n","Then Thomas called Didymus  said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.” \n   \n","When Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already spent four days in the tomb. \n","Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, a little less than two miles  away, \n","and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them in the loss of their brother. \n","So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him; but Mary stayed at home. \n   \n","Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. \n","But even now I know that God will give You whatever You ask of Him.” \n   \n","“Your brother will rise again,” Jesus told her. \n   \n","Martha replied, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” \n   \n","Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies. \n","And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?” \n   \n","“Yes, Lord,” she answered, “I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.” \n   \n","After Martha had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside to tell her, “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.” \n","And when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him. \n   \n","Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him. \n","When the Jews who were in the house consoling Mary saw how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. \n","When Mary came to Jesus and saw Him, she fell at His feet and said, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.” \n   \n","When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit  and troubled. \n","“Where have you put him?” He asked. \n  “Come and see, Lord,” they answered. \n   \n","Jesus wept. \n   \n","Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!” \n   \n","But some of them asked, “Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind also have kept Lazarus from dying?” \n   \n","Jesus, once again deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. \n","“Take away the stone,” Jesus said. \n  “Lord, by now he stinks,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man. “It has already been four days.” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” \n   \n","So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. \n","I knew that You always hear Me, but I say this for the benefit of the people standing here, so they may believe that You sent Me.” \n   \n","After Jesus had said this, He called out in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” \n   \n","The man who had been dead came out with his hands and feet bound in strips of linen, and his face wrapped in a cloth. \n  “Unwrap him and let him go,” Jesus told them. \n   \n","Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in Him. \n","But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. \n   \n","Then the chief priests and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin  and said, “What are we to do? This man is performing many signs. \n","If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.” \n   \n","But one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all! \n","You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.” \n   \n","Caiaphas did not say this on his own. Instead, as high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation, \n","and not only for the nation, but also for the scattered children of God, to gather them together into one. \n   \n","So from that day on they plotted to kill Him. \n","As a result, Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but He withdrew to a town called Ephraim in an area near the wilderness. And He stayed there with the disciples. \n   \n","Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Passover. \n","They kept looking for Jesus and asking one another as they stood in the temple courts, “What do you think? Will He come to the feast at all?” \n","But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where He was must report it, so that they could arrest Him. \n"],["Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, the hometown of Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. \n","So they hosted a dinner for Jesus there. Martha served, and Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with Him. \n","Then Mary took about a pint  of expensive perfume, made of pure nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet and wiped them with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. \n   \n","But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray Him, asked, \n","“Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii  and the money given to the poor?” \n","Judas did not say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money bag, he used to take from what was put into it. \n   \n","“Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “She has kept this perfume in preparation for the day of My burial. \n","The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have Me.” \n   \n","Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews learned that Jesus was there. And they came not only because of Him, but also to see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. \n","So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, \n","for on account of him many of the Jews were deserting them and believing in Jesus. \n   \n","The next day the great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. \n","They took palm branches and went out to meet Him, shouting: \n  “Hosanna!” \n  “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!” \n  “Blessed is the King of Israel!” \n   \n","Finding a young donkey, Jesus sat on it, as it is written: \n   \n","“Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion. \n See, your King is coming, \n seated on the colt of a donkey.” \n   \n","At first His disciples did not understand these things, but after Jesus was glorified they remembered what had been done to Him, and they realized that these very things had also been written about Him. \n   \n","Meanwhile, many people continued to testify that they had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead. \n","That is also why the crowd went out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign. \n   \n","Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You can see that this is doing you no good. Look how the whole world has gone after Him!” \n   \n","Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast. \n","They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested of him, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” \n","Philip relayed this appeal to Andrew, and both of them went and told Jesus. \n   \n","But Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. \n","Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a seed; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. \n","Whoever loves his life will lose it, but whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. \n","If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, My servant will be as well. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him. \n   \n","Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? No, it is for this purpose that I have come to this hour. \n","Father, glorify Your name!” \n  Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” \n   \n","The crowd standing there heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to Him. \n   \n","In response, Jesus said, “This voice was not for My benefit, but yours. \n","Now judgment is upon this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out. \n","And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to Myself.” \n","He said this to indicate the kind of death He was going to die. \n   \n","The crowd replied, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever. So how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” \n   \n","Then Jesus told them, “For a little while longer, the Light will be among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. \n","While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of light.” \n  After Jesus had spoken these things, He went away and was hidden from them. \n   \n","Although Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still did not believe in Him. \n","This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: \n  “Lord, who has believed our message? \n And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” \n   \n","For this reason they were unable to believe. For again, Isaiah says: \n   \n","“He has blinded their eyes \n and hardened their hearts, \n so that they cannot see with their eyes, \n and understand with their hearts, \n and turn, \n and I would heal them.” \n   \n","Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about Him. \n","Nevertheless, many of the leaders believed in Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue. \n","For they loved praise from men more than praise from God. \n   \n","Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in Me does not believe in Me alone, but in the One who sent Me. \n","And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me. \n","I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in Me should remain in darkness. \n   \n","As for anyone who hears My words and does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world. \n","There is a judge for the one who rejects Me and does not receive My words: The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. \n   \n","I have not spoken on My own, but the Father who sent Me has commanded Me what to say and how to say it. \n","And I know that His command leads to eternal life. So I speak exactly what the Father has told Me to say.” \n"],["It was now just before the Passover Feast, and Jesus knew that His hour had come to leave this world and return to the Father. Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the very end. \n","The evening meal was underway, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus. \n   \n","Jesus knew that the Father had delivered all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was returning to God. \n","So He got up from the supper, laid aside His outer garments, and wrapped a towel around His waist. \n","After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and dry them with the towel that was around Him. \n   \n","He came to Simon Peter, who asked Him, “Lord, are You going to wash my feet?” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” \n   \n","“Never shall You wash my feet!” Peter told Him. \n  Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.” \n   \n","“Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not only my feet, but my hands and my head as well!” \n   \n","Jesus told him, “Whoever has already bathed needs only to wash his feet, and he will be completely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” \n","For He knew who would betray Him. That is why He said, “Not all of you are clean.” \n   \n","When Jesus had washed their feet and put on His outer garments, He reclined with them again and asked, “Do you know what I have done for you? \n","You call Me Teacher and Lord, and rightly so, because I am. \n","So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. \n","I have set you an example so that you should do as I have done for you. \n","Truly, truly, I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. \n","If you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them. \n   \n","I am not speaking about all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the Scripture: ‘The one who shares My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.’ \n","I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it comes to pass, you will believe that I am He. \n","Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever receives the one I send receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives the One who sent Me.” \n   \n","After Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit and testified, “Truly, truly, I tell you, one of you will betray Me.” \n   \n","The disciples looked at one another, perplexed as to which of them He meant. \n","One of His disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining at His side. \n","So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus which one He was talking about. \n","Leaning back against Jesus, he asked, “Lord, who is it?” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I give this morsel after I have dipped it.” Then He dipped the morsel and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. \n","And when Judas had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. \n  Then Jesus said to Judas, “What you are about to do, do quickly.” \n","But no one at the table knew why Jesus had said this to him. \n","Since Judas kept the money bag, some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor. \n","As soon as he had received the morsel, Judas went out into the night. \n   \n","When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him. \n","If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify the Son in Himself—and will glorify Him at once. \n   \n","Little children, I am with you only a little while longer. You will look for Me, and as I said to the Jews, so now I say to you: ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’ \n   \n","A new commandment I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you also must love one another. \n","By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another.” \n   \n","“Lord, where are You going?” Simon Peter asked. \n  Jesus answered, “Where I am going, you cannot follow Me now, but you will follow later.” \n   \n","“Lord,” said Peter, “why can’t I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.” \n   \n","“Will you lay down your life for Me?” Jesus replied. “Truly, truly, I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times. \n"],["“Do not let your hearts be troubled.

They knew with certainty that I came from You, and they believed that You sent Me. \n   \n","I ask on their behalf. I do not ask on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those You have given Me; for they are Yours. \n","All I have is Yours, and all You have is Mine; and in them I have been glorified. \n","I will no longer be in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to You. \n  Holy Father, protect them by Your name, the name You gave Me, so that they may be one as We are one. \n","While I was with them, I protected and preserved them by Your name, the name You gave Me. Not one of them has been lost, except the son of destruction, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled. \n   \n","But now I am coming to You; and I am saying these things while I am in the world, so that they may have My joy fulfilled within them. \n","I have given them Your word and the world has hated them; for they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. \n   \n","I am not asking that You take them out of the world, but that You keep them from the evil one. \n","They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. \n","Sanctify them by the truth; Your word is truth. \n","As You sent Me into the world, I have also sent them into the world. \n","For them I sanctify Myself, so that they too may be sanctified by the truth. \n   \n","I am not asking on behalf of them alone, but also on behalf of those who will believe in Me through their message, \n","that all of them may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I am in You. May they also be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me. \n   \n","I have given them the glory You gave Me, so that they may be one as We are one—\n","I in them and You in Me—that they may be perfectly united, so that the world may know that You sent Me and have loved them just as You have loved Me. \n   \n","Father, I want those You have given Me to be with Me where I am, that they may see the glory You gave Me because You loved Me before the foundation of the world. \n   \n","Righteous Father, although the world has not known You, I know You, and they know that You sent Me. \n","And I have made Your name known to them and will continue to make it known, so that the love You have for Me may be in them, and I in them.” \n"],["After Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where they entered a garden. \n","Now Judas His betrayer also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with His disciples. \n","So Judas brought a band of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees. They arrived at the garden carrying lanterns, torches, and weapons. \n   \n","Jesus, knowing all that was coming upon Him, stepped forward and asked them, “Whom are you seeking?” \n   \n","“Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. \n  Jesus said, “I am He.” \n  And Judas His betrayer was standing there with them. \n","When Jesus said, “I am He,” they drew back and fell to the ground. \n   \n","So He asked them again, “Whom are you seeking?” \n  “Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. \n   \n","“I told you that I am He,” Jesus replied. “So if you are looking for Me, let these men go.” \n","This was to fulfill the word He had spoken: “I have not lost one of those You have given Me.” \n   \n","Then Simon Peter drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. \n   \n","“Put your sword back in its sheath!” Jesus said to Peter. “Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given Me?” \n   \n","Then the band of soldiers, with its commander and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him. \n","They brought Him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. \n","Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be better if one man died for the people. \n   \n","Now Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he also went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. \n","But Peter stood outside at the door. Then the disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in. \n   \n","At this, the servant girl watching the door said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?” \n  “I am not,” he answered. \n   \n","Because it was cold, the servants and officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made to keep warm. And Peter was also standing with them, warming himself. \n   \n","Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching. \n   \n","“I have spoken openly to the world,” Jesus answered. “I always taught in the synagogues and at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. \n","Why are you asking Me? Ask those who heard My message. Surely they know what I said.” \n   \n","When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing nearby slapped Him in the face and said, “Is this how You answer the high priest?” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “If I said something wrong, testify as to what was wrong. But if I spoke correctly, why did you strike Me?” \n   \n","Then Annas sent Him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. \n   \n","Simon Peter was still standing and warming himself. So they asked him, “Aren’t you also one of His disciples?” \n  He denied it and said, “I am not.” \n   \n","One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Didn’t I see you with Him in the garden?” \n   \n","Peter denied it once more, and immediately a rooster crowed. \n   \n","Then they led Jesus away from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. By now it was early morning, and the Jews did not enter the Praetorium, to avoid being defiled and unable to eat the Passover. \n   \n","So Pilate went out to them and asked, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?” \n   \n","“If He were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed Him over to you.” \n   \n","“You take Him and judge Him by your own law,” Pilate told them. \n  “We are not permitted to execute anyone,” the Jews replied. \n","This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to indicate the kind of death He was going to die. \n   \n","Pilate went back into the Praetorium, summoned Jesus, and asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” \n   \n","“Are you saying this on your own,” Jesus asked, “or did others tell you about Me?” \n   \n","“Am I a Jew?” Pilate replied. “Your own people and chief priests handed You over to me. What have You done?” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world; if it were, My servants would fight to prevent My arrest by the Jews. But now My kingdom is not of this realm.” \n   \n","“Then You are a king!” Pilate said. \n  “You say that I am a king,” Jesus answered. “For this reason I was born and have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to My voice.” \n   \n","“What is truth?” Pilate asked. \n  And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and told them, “I find no basis for a charge against Him. \n","But it is your custom that I release to you one prisoner at the Passover. So then, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” \n   \n","“Not this man,” they shouted, “but Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was an insurrectionist.) \n"],["Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him flogged. \n","The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns, set it on His head, and dressed Him in a purple robe. \n","And they went up to Him again and again, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping Him in the face. \n   \n","Once again Pilate came out and said to the Jews, “Look, I am bringing Him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against Him.” \n","When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!” \n   \n","As soon as the chief priests and officers saw Him, they shouted, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” \n  “You take Him and crucify Him,” Pilate replied, “for I find no basis for a charge against Him.” \n   \n","“We have a law,” answered the Jews, “and according to that law He must die, because He declared Himself to be the Son of God.” \n   \n","When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid, \n","and he went back into the Praetorium. “Where are You from?” he asked. \n  But Jesus gave no answer. \n   \n","So Pilate said to Him, “Do You refuse to speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You and authority to crucify You?” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “You would have no authority over Me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed Me over to you is guilty of greater sin.” \n   \n","From then on, Pilate tried to release Him, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who declares himself a king is defying Caesar.” \n   \n","When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat on the judgment seat at a place called the Stone Pavement, which in Hebrew  is Gabbatha. \n","It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour. And Pilate said to the Jews, “Here is your King!” \n   \n","At this, they shouted, “Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!” \n  “Shall I crucify your King?” Pilate asked. \n  “We have no king but Caesar,” replied the chief priests. \n   \n","Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified, and the soldiers took Him away. \n","Carrying His own cross, He went out to The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha. \n   \n","There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle. \n   \n","Pilate also had a notice posted on the cross. It read: \n  JESUS OF NAZARETH, \n THE KING OF THE JEWS. \n   \n","Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. \n","So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but only that He said, ‘I am the King of the Jews.’” \n   \n","Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.” \n   \n","When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided His garments into four parts, one for each soldier, with the tunic remaining. It was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. \n","So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it. Instead, let us cast lots to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill the Scripture: \n  “They divided My garments among them, \n and cast lots for My clothing.” \n  So that is what the soldiers did. \n   \n","Near the cross of Jesus stood His mother and her sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene. \n","When Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, “Woman, here is your son.” \n","Then He said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” So from that hour, this disciple took her into his home. \n   \n","After this, knowing that everything had now been accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.” \n","A jar of sour wine   was sitting there. So they soaked a sponge in the wine, put it on a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to His mouth. \n","When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished.” And bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit. \n   \n","It was the day of Preparation, and the next day was a High Sabbath. In order that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed. \n","So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and those of the other. \n   \n","But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. \n","Instead, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out. \n","The one who saw it has testified to this, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. \n   \n","Now these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of His bones will be broken.” \n","And, as another Scripture says: “They will look on the One they have pierced.” \n   \n","Afterward, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, so he came and removed His body. \n","Nicodemus, who had previously come to Jesus at night, also brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. \n","So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom. \n   \n","Now there was a garden in the place where Jesus was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. \n","And because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus there. \n"],["Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance. \n","So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,” she said, “and we do not know where they have put Him!” \n   \n","Then Peter and the other disciple set out for the tomb. \n","The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. \n","He bent down and looked in at the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. \n   \n","Simon Peter arrived just after him. He entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there. \n","The cloth  that had been around Jesus’ head was rolled up, lying separate from the linen cloths. \n","Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in. And he saw and believed. \n","For they still did not understand from the Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead. \n   \n","Then the disciples returned to their homes. \n","But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent down to look into the tomb, \n","and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet. \n   \n","“Woman, why are you weeping?” they asked. \n  “Because they have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I do not know where they have put Him.” \n   \n","When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there; but she did not recognize that it was Jesus. \n   \n","“Woman, why are you weeping?” Jesus asked. “Whom are you seeking?” \n  Thinking He was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried Him off, tell me where you have put Him, and I will get Him.” \n   \n","Jesus said to her, “Mary.” \n  She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”). \n   \n","“Do not cling to Me,” Jesus said, “for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go and tell My brothers, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.’” \n   \n","Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what He had said to her. \n   \n","It was the first day of the week, and that very evening, while the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them. “Peace be with you!” He said to them. \n","After He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. \n  The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. \n   \n","Again Jesus said to them, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me, so also I am sending you.” \n","When He had said this, He breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. \n","If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld.” \n   \n","Now Thomas called Didymus, one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. \n","So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” \n  But he replied, “Unless I see the nail marks in His hands, and put my finger where the nails have been, and put my hand into His side, I will never believe.” \n   \n","Eight days later, His disciples were once again inside with the doors locked, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” \n   \n","Then Jesus said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and look at My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Stop doubting and believe.” \n   \n","Thomas replied, “My Lord and my God!” \n   \n","Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.” \n   \n","Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book. \n","But these are written so that you may believe  that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name. \n"],["Later, by the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus again revealed Himself to the disciples. He made Himself known in this way: \n","Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. \n","Simon Peter told them, “I am going fishing.” \n  “We will go with you,” they said. So they went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night. \n   \n","Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not recognize that it was Jesus. \n","So He called out to them, “Children, do you have any fish?” \n  “No,” they answered. \n   \n","He told them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast it there, and they were unable to haul it in because of the great number of fish. \n   \n","Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it) and jumped into the sea. \n","The other disciples came ashore in the boat. They dragged in the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards. \n   \n","When they landed, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it, and some bread. \n   \n","Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.” \n","So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many, the net was not torn. \n   \n","“Come, have breakfast,” Jesus said to them. None of the disciples dared to ask Him, “Who are You?” They knew it was the Lord. \n","Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and He did the same with the fish. \n   \n","This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after He was raised from the dead. \n   \n","When they had finished eating, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love Me more than these?” \n  “Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know I love You.” \n  Jesus replied, “Feed My lambs.” \n   \n","Jesus asked a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love Me?” \n  “Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know I love You.” \n  Jesus told him, “Shepherd My sheep.” \n   \n","Jesus asked a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love Me?” \n  Peter was deeply hurt that Jesus had asked him a third time, “Do you love Me?” \n  “Lord, You know all things,” he replied. “You know I love You.” \n  Jesus said to him, “Feed My sheep. \n   \n","Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else  will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.” \n","Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. \n  And after He had said this, He told him, “Follow Me.” \n   \n","Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them. He was the one who had leaned back against Jesus  at the supper to ask, “Lord, who is going to betray You?” \n","When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?” \n   \n","Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you? You follow Me!” \n","Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say that he would not die, but only, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you?” \n   \n","This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who has written them down. And we know that his testimony is true. \n   \n","There are many more things that Jesus did. If all of them were written down, I suppose that not even the world itself would have space for the books that would be written. "]],"Acts":[["In my first book, O Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach, \n","until the day He was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles He had chosen. \n","After His suffering, He presented Himself to them with many convincing proofs that He was alive. He appeared to them over a span of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. \n   \n","And while they were gathered together, He commanded them: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift the Father promised, which you have heard Me discuss. \n","For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. ” \n   \n","So when they came together, they asked Him, “Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” \n   \n","Jesus replied, “It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by His own authority. \n","But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” \n   \n","After He had said this, they watched as He was taken up, and a cloud hid Him from their sight. \n","They were looking intently into the sky as He was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. \n","“Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen Him go into heaven.” \n   \n","Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near the city, a Sabbath day’s journey away. \n","When they arrived, they went to the upper room where they were staying: Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. \n","With one accord they all continued in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers. \n   \n","In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (a gathering of about a hundred and twenty) and said, \n","“Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit foretold through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus. \n","He was one of our number and shared in this ministry.” \n   \n","(Now with the reward for his wickedness Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong and burst open in the middle, and all his intestines spilled out. \n","This became known to all who lived in Jerusalem, so they called that field in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) \n   \n","“For it is written in the book of Psalms: \n  ‘May his place be deserted; \n let there be no one to dwell in it,’ \n  and, \n  ‘May another take his position.’ \n   \n","Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have accompanied us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, \n","beginning from John’s baptism until the day Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.” \n   \n","So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. \n","And they prayed, “Lord, You know everyone’s heart.

They could not find a way to punish them, because all the people were glorifying God for what had happened. \n","For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old. \n   \n","On their release, Peter and John returned to their own people and reported everything that the chief priests and elders had said to them. \n","When the believers heard this, they lifted up their voices to God with one accord. “Sovereign Lord,” they said, “You made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them. \n","You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of Your servant, our father David: \n  ‘Why do the nations rage \n and the peoples plot in vain? \n  \n","The kings of the earth take their stand \n and the rulers gather together \n against the Lord \n and against His Anointed One.’ \n   \n","In fact, this is the very city where Herod and Pontius Pilate conspired with the Gentiles and the people of Israel against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed. \n","They carried out what Your hand and will had decided beforehand would happen. \n","And now, Lord, consider their threats, and enable Your servants to speak Your word with complete boldness, \n","as You stretch out Your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of Your holy servant Jesus.” \n   \n","After they had prayed, their meeting place was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly. \n   \n","The multitude of believers was one in heart and soul. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they owned. \n","With great power the apostles continued to give their testimony about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And abundant grace was upon them all. \n   \n","There were no needy ones among them, because those who owned lands or houses would sell their property, bring the proceeds from the sales, \n","and lay them at the apostles’ feet for distribution to anyone as he had need. \n   \n","Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (meaning Son of Encouragement), \n","sold a field he owned, brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet. \n"],["Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. \n","With his wife’s full knowledge, he kept back some of the proceeds for himself, but brought a portion and laid it at the apostles’ feet. \n   \n","Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and withhold some of the proceeds from the land? \n","Did it not belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How could you conceive such a deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God!” \n   \n","On hearing these words, Ananias fell down and died. And great fear came over all who heard what had happened. \n","Then the young men stepped forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him. \n   \n","About three hours later his wife also came in, unaware of what had happened. \n","“Tell me,” said Peter, “is this the price you and your husband got for the land?” \n  “Yes,” she answered, “that is the price.” \n   \n","“How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord?” Peter replied. “Look, the feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.” \n   \n","At that instant she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband. \n","And great fear came over the whole church and all who heard about these events. \n   \n","The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people, and with one accord the believers gathered together in Solomon’s Colonnade. \n","Although the people regarded them highly, no one else dared to join them. \n","Yet more and more believers were brought to the Lord—large numbers of both men and women. \n   \n","As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats, so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. \n","Crowds also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, and all of them were healed. \n   \n","Then the high priest and all his associates, who belonged to the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy. They went out \n","and arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. \n","But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out, saying, \n","“Go, stand in the temple courts  and tell the people the full message of this new life.” \n   \n","At daybreak the apostles entered the temple courts as they had been told and began to teach the people. \n  When the high priest and his associates arrived, they convened the Sanhedrin —the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles. \n","But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they returned with the report: \n","“We found the jail securely locked, with the guards posted at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.” \n   \n","When the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard this account, they were perplexed as to what was happening. \n","Then someone came in and announced, “Look, the men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people!” \n   \n","At that point, the captain went with the officers and brought the apostles—but not by force, for fear the people would stone them. \n","They brought them in and made them stand before the Sanhedrin, where the high priest interrogated them. \n","“We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” he said. “Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us responsible for this man’s blood.” \n   \n","But Peter and the other apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than men. \n","The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had killed by hanging Him on a tree. \n","God exalted Him to His right hand as Prince and Savior, in order to grant repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel. \n","We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.” \n   \n","When the Council members heard this, they were enraged, and they resolved  to put the apostles to death. \n","But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a short time. \n   \n","“Men of Israel,” he said, “consider carefully what you are about to do to these men. \n","Some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men joined him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. \n","After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and drew away people after him. He too perished, and all his followers were scattered. \n   \n","So in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone. Let them go! For if their purpose or endeavor is of human origin, it will fail. \n","But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop them. You may even find yourselves fighting against God.” \n   \n","At this, they yielded to Gamaliel. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them. \n   \n","The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. \n","Every day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they did not stop teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ. \n"],["In those days when the disciples were increasing in number, the Grecian Jews among them began to grumble against the Hebraic Jews  because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. \n   \n","So the Twelve summoned all the disciples and said, “It is unacceptable for us to neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables. \n","Therefore, brothers, select from among you seven men confirmed to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will appoint this responsibility to them \n","and will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” \n   \n","This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, as well as Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. \n","They presented these seven to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. \n   \n","So the word of God continued to spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem grew rapidly, and a great number of priests became obedient to the faith. \n   \n","Now Stephen, who was full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people. \n","But resistance arose from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, including Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and men from the provinces of Cilicia and Asia. They began to argue with Stephen, \n","but they could not stand up to his wisdom or the Spirit by whom he spoke. \n   \n","Then they prompted some men to say, “We heard Stephen speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God.” \n   \n","So they stirred up the people, elders, and scribes and confronted Stephen. They seized him and brought him before the Sanhedrin, \n","where they presented false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law. \n","For we have heard him say that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.” \n   \n","All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel. \n"],["Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Are these charges true?” \n   \n","And Stephen declared: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, \n","and told him, ‘Leave your country and your kindred and go to the land I will show you.’ \n","So Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, God brought him out of that place and into this land where you are now living. \n   \n","He gave him no inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. But God promised to give possession of the land to Abraham and his descendants, even though he did not yet have a child. \n","God told him that his descendants would be foreigners in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. \n","‘But I will punish the nation that enslaves them,’ God said, ‘and afterward they will come forth and worship Me in this place.’ \n   \n","Then God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, and Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. And Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs. \n   \n","Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him \n","and rescued him from all his troubles. He granted Joseph favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler over Egypt and all his household. \n   \n","Then famine and great suffering swept across Egypt and Canaan, and our fathers could not find food. \n","When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit. \n","On their second visit, Joseph revealed his identity to  his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh. \n","Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob and all his relatives, seventy-five in all. \n   \n","So Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our fathers died. \n","Their bones were carried back  to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a price he paid in silver. \n   \n","As the time drew near for God to fulfill His promise to Abraham, our people in Egypt increased greatly in number. \n","Then another king, who knew nothing of Joseph, arose over Egypt. \n","He exploited our people and oppressed our fathers, forcing them to abandon their infants so they would die. \n   \n","At that time Moses was born, and he was beautiful in the sight of God. For three months he was nurtured in his father’s house. \n","When he was set outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and brought him up as her own son. \n","So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action. \n   \n","When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his brothers, the children of Israel. \n","And when he saw one of them being mistreated, Moses went to his defense and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian who was oppressing him. \n","He assumed his brothers would understand that God was using him to deliver them, but they did not. \n   \n","The next day he came upon two Israelites who were fighting, and he tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers. Why are you mistreating each other?’ \n   \n","But the man who was abusing his neighbor pushed Moses aside and said, ‘Who made you ruler and judge over us? \n","Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’ \n","At this remark, Moses fled to the land of Midian, where he lived as a foreigner and had two sons. \n   \n","After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. \n","When Moses saw it, he marveled at the sight. As he approached to look more closely, the voice of the Lord came to him: \n","‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look. \n   \n","Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. \n","I have indeed seen the oppression of My people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.’ \n   \n","This Moses, whom they had rejected with the words, ‘Who made you ruler and judge?’  is the one whom God sent to be their ruler and redeemer through the angel  who appeared to him in the bush. \n","He led them out and performed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, at the Red Sea, and for forty years in the wilderness. \n   \n","This is the same Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers.’ \n","He was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. And he received living words to pass on to us. \n   \n","But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. \n","They said to Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go before us! As for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.’ \n   \n","At that time they made a calf and offered a sacrifice to the idol, rejoicing in the works of their hands. \n","But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: \n  ‘Did you bring Me sacrifices and offerings \n forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel? \n  \n","You have taken along the tabernacle of Molech \n and the star of your god Rephan, \n the idols you made to worship. \n Therefore I will send you into exile \n beyond Babylon.’ \n   \n","Our fathers had the tabernacle of the Testimony with them in the wilderness. It was constructed exactly as God had directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen. \n","And our fathers who received it brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations God drove out before them. It remained until the time of David, \n","who found favor in the sight of God and asked to provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. \n","But it was Solomon who built the house for Him. \n   \n","However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says: \n   \n","‘Heaven is My throne \n and the earth is My footstool. \n What kind of house will you build for Me, says the Lord, \n or where will My place of repose be? \n  \n","Has not My hand made all these things?’ \n   \n","You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit, just as your fathers did. \n","Which of the prophets did your fathers fail to persecute? They even killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One. And now you are His betrayers and murderers—\n","you who received the law ordained by angels, yet have not kept it.” \n   \n","On hearing this, the members of the Sanhedrin were enraged, and they gnashed their teeth at him. \n","But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. \n","“Look,” he said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.” \n   \n","At this they covered their ears, cried out in a loud voice, and rushed together at him. \n","They dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile the witnesses laid their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. \n   \n","While they were stoning him, Stephen appealed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” \n","Falling on his knees, he cried out in a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” And when he had said this, he fell asleep. \n"],["And Saul was there, giving approval to Stephen’s death. \n  On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. \n","God-fearing men buried Stephen and mourned deeply over him. \n","But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison. \n   \n","Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. \n","Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them. \n","The crowds gave their undivided attention to Philip’s message and to the signs they saw him perform. \n","With loud shrieks, unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, and many of the paralyzed and lame were healed. \n","So there was great joy in that city. \n   \n","Prior to that time, a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and astounded the people of Samaria. He claimed to be someone great, \n","and all the people, from the least to the greatest, heeded his words and said, “This man is the divine power called the Great Power.” \n","They paid close attention to him because he had astounded them for a long time with his sorcery. \n   \n","But when they believed Philip as he preached the gospel of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. \n","Even Simon himself believed and was baptized. He followed Philip closely and was astounded by the great signs and miracles he observed. \n   \n","When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. \n","On their arrival, they prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit. \n","For the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. \n","Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. \n   \n","When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money. \n","“Give me this power as well,” he said, “so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.” \n   \n","But Peter replied, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! \n","You have no part or share in our ministry, because your heart is not right before God. \n","Repent, therefore, of your wickedness, and pray to the Lord. Perhaps He will forgive you for the intent of your heart. \n","For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and captive to iniquity.” \n   \n","Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing you have said may happen to me.” \n   \n","And after Peter and John had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many of the Samaritan villages. \n   \n","Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south to the desert road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” \n","So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official in charge of the entire treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship, \n","and on his return was sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet. \n   \n","The Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to that chariot and stay by it.” \n   \n","So Philip ran up and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked. \n   \n","“How can I,” he said, “unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. \n   \n","The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: \n  “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, \n and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, \n so He did not open His mouth. \n  \n","In His humiliation He was deprived of justice. \n Who can recount His descendants? \n For His life was removed from the earth.” \n   \n","“Tell me,” said the eunuch, “who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?” \n   \n","Then Philip began with this very Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. \n   \n","As they traveled along the road and came to some water, the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is there to prevent me from being baptized?” \n",null,"And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. \n   \n","When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing. \n"],["Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord. He approached the high priest \n","and requested letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way, he could bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem. \n   \n","As Saul drew near to Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. \n","He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?” \n   \n","“Who are You, Lord?” Saul asked. \n  “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” He replied. \n","“Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.” \n   \n","The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless. They heard the voice but did not see anyone. \n","Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could not see a thing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. \n","For three days he was without sight, and he did not eat or drink anything. \n   \n","In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, “Ananias!” \n  “Here I am, Lord,” he answered. \n   \n","“Get up!” the Lord told him. “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. \n","In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.” \n   \n","But Ananias answered, “Lord, many people have told me about this man and all the harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem. \n","And now he is here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on Your name.” \n   \n","“Go!” said the Lord. “This man is My chosen instrument to carry My name before the Gentiles and their kings, and before the people of Israel. \n","I will show him how much he must suffer for My name.” \n   \n","So Ananias went to the house, and when he arrived, he placed his hands on Saul. “Brother Saul,” he said, “the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” \n   \n","At that instant, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and his sight was restored. He got up and was baptized, \n","and after taking some food, he regained his strength. And he spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. \n   \n","Saul promptly began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, declaring, “He is the Son of God.” \n   \n","All who heard him were astounded and asked, “Isn’t this the man who wreaked havoc in Jerusalem on those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?” \n   \n","But Saul was empowered all the more, and he confounded the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ. \n   \n","After many days had passed, the Jews conspired to kill him, \n","but Saul learned of their plot. Day and night they watched the city gates in order to kill him. \n","One night, however, his disciples took him and lowered him in a basket through a window in the wall. \n   \n","When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. \n","Then Barnabas brought him to the apostles and described how Saul had seen the Lord, who spoke to him on the road to Damascus, and how Saul had spoken boldly in that city in the name of Jesus. \n   \n","So Saul stayed with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. \n","He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews, but they tried to kill him. \n","When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus. \n   \n","Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria experienced a time of peace. It grew in strength and numbers, living in the fear of the Lord and the encouragement of the Holy Spirit. \n   \n","As Peter traveled throughout the area, he went to visit the saints in Lydda. \n","There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years. \n","“Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ heals you! Get up and put away your mat.” Immediately Aeneas got up, \n","and all who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord. \n   \n","In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which is translated as Dorcas), who was always occupied with works of kindness and charity. \n","At that time, however, she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upper room. \n","Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there and sent two men to urge him, “Come to us without delay.” \n   \n","So Peter got up and went with them. On his arrival, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood around him, weeping and showing him the tunics and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them. \n   \n","Then Peter sent them all out of the room. He knelt down and prayed, and turning toward her body, he said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up. \n","Peter took her by the hand and helped her up. Then he called the saints and widows and presented her to them alive. \n   \n","This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord. \n","And Peter stayed for several days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon. \n"],["At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was called the Italian Regiment. \n","He and all his household were devout and God-fearing. He gave generously to the people and prayed to God regularly. \n","One day at about the ninth hour, he had a clear vision of an angel of God who came to him and said, “Cornelius!” \n   \n","Cornelius stared at him in fear and asked, “What is it, Lord?” \n  The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have ascended as a memorial offering before God. \n","Now send men to Joppa to call for a man named Simon who is called Peter. \n","He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea. ” \n   \n","When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among his attendants. \n","He explained what had happened and sent them to Joppa. \n   \n","The next day at about the sixth hour, as the men were approaching the city on their journey, Peter went up on the roof to pray. \n","He became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. \n   \n","He saw heaven open and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. \n","It contained all kinds of four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth, as well as birds of the air. \n","Then a voice said to him: “Get up, Peter, kill and eat!” \n   \n","“No, Lord!” Peter answered. “I have never eaten anything impure  or unclean.” \n   \n","The voice spoke to him a second time: “Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.” \n   \n","This happened three times, and all at once the sheet was taken back up into heaven. \n   \n","While Peter was puzzling over the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found Simon’s house and approached the gate. \n","They called out to ask if Simon called Peter was staying there. \n   \n","As Peter continued to reflect on the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you. \n","So get up! Go downstairs and accompany them without hesitation, because I have sent them.” \n   \n","So Peter went down to the men  and said, “Here am I, the one you are looking for. Why have you come?” \n   \n","“Cornelius the centurion has sent us,” they said. “He is a righteous and God-fearing man with a good reputation among the whole Jewish nation. A holy angel instructed him to request your presence in his home so he could hear a message from you.” \n   \n","So Peter invited them in as his guests. And the next day he got ready and went with them, accompanied by some of the brothers from Joppa. \n   \n","The following day he arrived in Caesarea, where Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. \n","As Peter was about to enter, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet to worship him. \n","But Peter helped him up. “Stand up,” he said, “I am only a man myself.” \n   \n","As Peter talked with him, he went inside and found many people gathered together. \n","He said to them, “You know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with a foreigner or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean. \n","So when I was invited, I came without objection. I ask, then, why have you sent for me?” \n   \n","Cornelius answered: “Four days ago I was in my house praying at this, the ninth hour. Suddenly a man in radiant clothing stood before me \n","and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your gifts to the poor have been remembered before God. \n","Therefore send to Joppa for Simon, who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, by the sea.’ \n   \n","So I sent for you immediately, and you were kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has instructed you to tell us.” \n   \n","Then Peter began to speak: “I now truly understand that God does not show favoritism, \n","but welcomes those from every nation who fear Him and do what is right. \n","He has sent this message to the people of Israel, proclaiming the gospel of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. \n   \n","You yourselves know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee with the baptism that John proclaimed: \n","how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how Jesus went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with Him. \n   \n","We are witnesses of all that He did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. And although they put Him to death by hanging Him on a tree, \n","God raised Him up on the third day and caused Him to be seen—\n","not by all the people, but by the witnesses God had chosen beforehand, by us who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead. \n","And He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that He is the One appointed by God to judge the living and the dead. \n","All the prophets testify about Him that everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins through His name.” \n   \n","While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard his message. \n","All the circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. \n","For they heard them speaking in tongues and exalting God. \n  Then Peter said, \n","“Can anyone withhold the water to baptize these people? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have!” \n","So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for a few days. \n"],["The apostles and brothers throughout Judea soon heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. \n","So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers  took issue with him \n","and said, “You visited uncircumcised men and ate with them.” \n   \n","But Peter began and explained to them the whole sequence of events: \n","“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision of something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came right down to me. \n","I looked at it closely and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air. \n","Then I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter, kill and eat.’ \n   \n","‘No, Lord,’ I said, ‘for nothing impure  or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ \n   \n","But the voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’ \n   \n","This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into heaven. \n   \n","Just then three men sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. \n","The Spirit told me to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s home. \n","He told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. \n","He will convey to you a message by which you and all your household will be saved.’ \n   \n","As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as He had fallen upon us at the beginning. \n","Then I remembered the word of the Lord, as He used to say, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ \n","So if God gave them the same gift He gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder the work of God?” \n   \n","When they heard this, their objections were put to rest, and they glorified God, saying, “So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.” \n   \n","Meanwhile those scattered by the persecution that began with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message only to Jews. \n","But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks  as well, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus. \n","The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord. \n   \n","When news of this reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas to Antioch. \n","When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to abide in the Lord with all their hearts. \n","Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord. \n   \n","Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, \n","and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. So for a full year they met together with the church and taught large numbers of people. The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch. \n   \n","In those days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. \n","One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted through the Spirit that a great famine would sweep across the whole world. (This happened under Claudius.) \n","So the disciples, each according to his ability, decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea. \n","This they did, sending their gifts to the elders with Barnabas and Saul. \n"],["About that time, King Herod   reached out to harm  some who belonged to the church. \n","He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword. \n   \n","And seeing that this pleased the Jews, Herod proceeded to seize Peter during the Feast of Unleavened Bread. \n","He arrested him and put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out to the people after the Passover. \n   \n","So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was fervently praying to God for him. \n   \n","On the night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, with sentries standing guard at the entrance to the prison. \n","Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, “Get up quickly.” And the chains fell off his wrists. \n","“Get dressed and put on your sandals,” said the angel. Peter did so, and the angel told him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.” \n   \n","So Peter followed him out, but he was unaware that what the angel was doing was real. He thought he was only seeing a vision. \n","They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city, which opened for them by itself. When they had gone outside and walked the length of one block, the angel suddenly left him. \n   \n","Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent His angel and rescued me from Herod’s grasp and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating.” \n   \n","And when he had realized this, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered together and were praying. \n","He knocked at the outer gate, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer it. \n","When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed that she forgot to open the gate, but ran inside and announced, “Peter is standing at the gate!” \n   \n","“You are out of your mind,” they told her. But when she kept insisting it was so, they said, “It must be his angel.” \n   \n","But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astounded. \n","Peter motioned with his hand for silence, and he described how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. “Send word to James and to the brothers,” he said, and he left for another place. \n   \n","At daybreak there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. \n","After Herod had searched for him unsuccessfully, he examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent some time there. \n   \n","Now Herod was in a furious dispute  with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they convened before him. Having secured the support of Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their region depended on the king’s country for food. \n","On the appointed day, Herod donned his royal robes, sat on his throne, and addressed the people. \n","And they began to shout, “This is the voice of a god, not a man!” \n   \n","Immediately, because Herod did not give glory to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died. \n   \n","But the word of God continued to spread and multiply. \n   \n","When Barnabas and Saul had fulfilled their mission to Jerusalem, they returned, bringing with them John, also called Mark. \n"],["Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch), and Saul. \n","While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” \n","And after they had fasted and prayed, they laid their hands on them and sent them off. \n   \n","So Barnabas and Saul, sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus. \n","When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. And John was with them as their helper. \n   \n","They traveled through the whole island as far as Paphos, where they found a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, \n","an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, a man of intelligence, summoned Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God. \n","But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith. \n   \n","Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked directly at Elymas \n","and said, “O child of the devil and enemy of all righteousness, you are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery! Will you never stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord? \n","Now look, the hand of the Lord is against you, and for a time you will be blind and unable to see the light of the sun.” Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand. \n   \n","When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord. \n   \n","After setting sail from Paphos, Paul and his companions came to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem. \n","And from Perga, they traveled inland to Pisidian Antioch, where they entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and sat down. \n","After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders sent word to them: “Brothers, if you have a word of encouragement for the people, please speak.” \n   \n","Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and began to speak: “Men of Israel and you Gentiles who fear God, listen to me! \n","The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers. He made them into a great people during their stay in Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out of that land. \n","He endured their conduct for about forty years in the wilderness. \n","And having vanquished seven nations in Canaan, He gave their land to His people as an inheritance. \n","All this took about 450 years. \n  After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. \n","Then the people asked for a king, and God gave them forty years under Saul son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin. \n","After removing Saul, He raised up David as their king and testified about him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse a man after My own heart; he will carry out My will in its entirety.’ \n   \n","From the descendants of this man, God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as He promised. \n","Before the arrival of Jesus, John preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. \n","As John was completing his course, he said, ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not that One. But He is coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’ \n   \n","Brothers, children of Abraham, and you Gentiles who fear God, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent. \n","The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning Him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. \n","And though they found no ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have Him executed. \n   \n","When they had carried out all that was written about Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb. \n","But God raised Him from the dead, \n","and for many days He was seen by those who had accompanied Him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now His witnesses to our people. \n   \n","And now we proclaim to you the good news: What God promised our fathers \n","He has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: \n  ‘You are My Son; \n today I have become Your Father.’ \n   \n","In fact, God raised Him from the dead, never to see decay. As He has said: \n  ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’ \n   \n","So also, He says in another Psalm: \n  ‘You will not let Your Holy One see decay.’ \n   \n","For when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep. His body was buried with his fathers and saw decay. \n","But the One whom God raised from the dead did not see decay. \n   \n","Therefore let it be known to you, brothers, that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. \n","Through Him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses. \n","Watch out, then, that what was spoken by the prophets does not happen to you: \n   \n","‘Look, you scoffers, \n wonder and perish! \n For I am doing a work in your days \n that you would never believe, \n even if someone told you.’ ” \n   \n","As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people urged them to continue this message on the next Sabbath. \n","After the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God. \n   \n","On the following Sabbath, nearly the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. \n","But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and they blasphemously contradicted what Paul was saying. \n   \n","Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “It was necessary to speak the word of God to you first. But since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles. \n","For this is what the Lord has commanded us: \n  ‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles, \n to bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’ ” \n   \n","When the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord, and all who were appointed for eternal life believed. \n","And the word of the Lord spread throughout that region. \n   \n","The Jews, however, incited the religious women of prominence and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their district. \n","So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium. \n","And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. \n"],["At Iconium, Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue, where they spoke so well that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed. \n","But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. \n","So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who affirmed the message of His grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders. \n   \n","The people of the city were divided. Some sided with the Jews, and others with the apostles. \n","But when the Gentiles and Jews, together with their rulers, set out to mistreat and stone them, \n","they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding region, \n","where they continued to preach the gospel. \n   \n","In Lystra there sat a man crippled in his feet, who was lame from birth and had never walked. \n","This man was listening to the words of Paul, who looked intently at him and saw that he had faith to be healed. \n","In a loud voice Paul called out, “Stand up on your feet!” And the man jumped up and began to walk. \n   \n","When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices in the Lycaonian language: “The gods have come down to us in human form!” \n","Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. \n","The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates, hoping to offer a sacrifice along with the crowds. \n   \n","But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul found out about this, they tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, shouting, \n","“Men, why are you doing this? We too are only men, human like you. We are bringing you good news that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them. \n","In past generations, He let all nations go their own way. \n","Yet He has not left Himself without testimony to His goodness: He gives you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.” \n   \n","Even with these words, Paul and Barnabas could hardly stop the crowds from sacrificing to them. \n   \n","Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, presuming he was dead. \n","But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. And the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe. \n   \n","They preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, \n","strengthening the souls of the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith. “We must endure many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,” they said. \n   \n","Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church, praying and fasting as they entrusted them to the Lord, in whom they had believed. \n   \n","After passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. \n","And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. \n   \n","From Attalia they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had just completed. \n","When they arrived, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them, and how He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles. \n","And they spent a long time there with the disciples. \n"],["Then some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.” \n","And after engaging these men in sharp debate, Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question. \n   \n","Sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, recounting the conversion of the Gentiles and bringing great joy to all the brothers. \n","On their arrival in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and apostles and elders, to whom they reported all that God had done through them. \n   \n","But some believers from the party of the Pharisees stood up and declared, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses.” \n","So the apostles and elders met to look into this matter. \n   \n","After much discussion, Peter got up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you that the Gentiles would hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. \n","And God, who knows the heart, showed His approval by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as He did to us. \n","He made no distinction between us and them, for He cleansed their hearts by faith. \n   \n","Now then, why do you test God by placing on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? \n","On the contrary, we believe it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.” \n   \n","The whole assembly fell silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul describing the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. \n","When they had finished speaking, James declared, “Brothers, listen to me! \n","Simon  has told us how God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people to be His own. \n","The words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written: \n   \n","‘After this I will return and rebuild \n the fallen tent of David. \n Its ruins I will rebuild, \n and I will restore it, \n  \n","so that the remnant of men may seek the Lord, \n and all the Gentiles who are called by My name, \n says the Lord who does these things \n  \n","that have been known for ages.’ \n   \n","It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not cause trouble for the Gentiles who are turning to God. \n","Instead, we should write and tell them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood. \n","For Moses has been proclaimed in every city from ancient times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.” \n   \n","Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to select men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas called Barsabbas and Silas, two leaders among the brothers, \n","and sent them with this letter: \n  The apostles and the elders, your brothers, \n  To the brothers among the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: \n  Greetings. \n   \n","It has come to our attention that some went out from us without our authorization and unsettled you, troubling your minds by what they said. \n","So we all agreed to choose men to send to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, \n","men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. \n","Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to tell you in person the same things we are writing. \n   \n","It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond these essential requirements: \n","You must abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. \n  Farewell. \n   \n","So the men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they assembled the congregation and delivered the letter. \n","When the people read it, they rejoiced at its encouraging message. \n   \n","Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers. \n","After spending some time there, they were sent off by the brothers in peace to return to those who had sent them. \n",null,"But Paul and Barnabas remained at Antioch, along with many others, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord. \n   \n","Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the brothers in every town where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.” \n","Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark. \n","But Paul thought it best not to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work. \n   \n","Their disagreement was so sharp that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, \n","but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. \n"],["Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where he found a disciple named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewish woman and a Greek father. \n","The brothers in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. \n","Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, so he took him and circumcised him on account of the Jews in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. \n   \n","As they went from town to town, they delivered the decisions handed down by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey. \n","So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers. \n   \n","After the Holy Spirit had prevented them from speaking the word in the province of Asia, they traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia. \n","And when they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not permit them. \n","So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. \n   \n","During the night, Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and pleading with him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” \n","As soon as Paul had seen the vision, we got ready to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. \n   \n","We sailed from Troas straight to Samothrace, and the following day on to Neapolis. \n","From there we went to the Roman colony of Philippi, the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days. \n   \n","On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate along the river, where it was customary to find a place of prayer. After sitting down, we spoke to the women who had gathered there. \n   \n","Among those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message. \n","And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, “If you consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house.” And she persuaded us. \n   \n","One day as we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl with a spirit of divination, who earned a large income for her masters by fortune-telling. \n","This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation!” \n   \n","She continued this for many days. Eventually Paul grew so aggravated that he turned and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” And the spirit left her at that very moment. \n   \n","When the girl’s owners saw that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the marketplace. \n","They brought them to the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews and are throwing our city into turmoil \n","by promoting customs that are unlawful for us Romans to adopt or practice.” \n   \n","The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered that they be stripped and beaten with rods. \n","And after striking them with many blows, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to guard them securely. \n","On receiving this order, he placed them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks. \n   \n","About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. \n","Suddenly a strong earthquake shook the foundations of the prison. At once all the doors flew open and everyone’s chains came loose. \n   \n","When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, presuming that the prisoners had escaped. \n","But Paul called out in a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself! We are all here!” \n   \n","Calling for lights, the jailer rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. \n","Then he brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” \n   \n","They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household.” \n","Then Paul and Silas spoke the word of the Lord to him and to everyone in his house. \n","At that hour of the night, the jailer took them and washed their wounds. And without delay, he and all his household were baptized. \n","Then he brought them into his home and set a meal before them. So he and all his household rejoiced that they had come to believe in God. \n   \n","When daylight came, the magistrates sent their officers with the order: “Release those men.” \n   \n","The jailer informed Paul: “The magistrates have sent orders to release you. Now you may go on your way in peace.” \n   \n","But Paul said to the officers, “They beat us publicly without a trial and threw us into prison, even though we are Roman citizens. And now do they want to send us away secretly? Absolutely not! Let them come themselves and escort us out!” \n   \n","So the officers relayed this message to the magistrates, who were alarmed to hear that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens. \n","They came to appease them and led them out, requesting that they leave the city. \n","After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house to see the brothers and encourage them. Then they left the city. \n"],["When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. \n","As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, \n","explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ,” he declared. \n","Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few leading women. \n   \n","The Jews, however, became jealous. So they brought in some troublemakers from the marketplace, formed a mob, and sent the city into an uproar. They raided Jason’s house in search of Paul and Silas, hoping to bring them out to the people. \n","But when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting, “These men who have turned the world upside down have now come here, \n","and Jason has welcomed them into his home. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, named Jesus!” \n   \n","On hearing this, the crowd and city officials were greatly disturbed. \n","And they collected bond from Jason and the others, and then released them. \n   \n","As soon as night had fallen, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went into the Jewish synagogue. \n","Now the Bereans were more noble-minded than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if these teachings were true. \n","As a result, many of them believed, along with quite a few prominent Greek women and men. \n   \n","But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that Paul was also proclaiming the word of God in Berea, they went there themselves to incite and agitate the crowds. \n","The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy remained in Berea. \n","Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then returned with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible. \n   \n","While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was deeply disturbed in his spirit to see that the city was full of idols. \n","So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and God-fearing Gentiles, and in the marketplace with those he met each day. \n   \n","Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also began to debate with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others said, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was proclaiming the good news of Jesus and the resurrection. \n   \n","So they took Paul and brought him to the Areopagus, where they asked him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? \n","For you are bringing some strange notions to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.” \n   \n","Now all the Athenians and foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing more than hearing and articulating new ideas. \n   \n","Then Paul stood up in the meeting  of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that in every way you are very religious. \n","For as I walked around and examined your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: \n  TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. \n  Therefore what you worship as something unknown, I now proclaim to you. \n   \n","The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples made by human hands. \n","Nor is He served by human hands, as if He needed anything, because He Himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else. \n","From one man  He made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and He determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands. \n   \n","God intended that they would seek Him and perhaps reach out for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us. \n","‘For in Him we live and move and have our being.’  As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are His offspring.’ \n","Therefore, being offspring of God, we should not think that the Divine Being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by man’s skill and imagination. \n   \n","Although God overlooked the ignorance of earlier times, He now commands all people everywhere to repent. \n","For He has set a day when He will judge the world with justice by the Man He has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising Him from the dead.” \n   \n","When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some began to mock him, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this topic.” \n","At that, Paul left the Areopagus. \n","But some  joined him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others who were with them. \n"],["After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. \n","There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them, \n","and he stayed and worked with them because they were tentmakers by trade, just as he was. \n   \n","Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks alike. \n","And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself fully to the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ. \n","But when they opposed and insulted him, he shook out his garments and told them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.” \n   \n","So Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titus Justus, a worshiper of God. \n","Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his whole household believed in the Lord. And many of the Corinthians who heard the message believed and were baptized. \n   \n","One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid; keep on speaking; do not be silent. \n","For I am with you and no one will lay a hand on you, because I have many people in this city.” \n","So Paul stayed for a year and a half, teaching the word of God among the Corinthians. \n   \n","While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews coordinated an attack on Paul and brought him before the judgment seat. \n","“This man is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law,” they said. \n   \n","But just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio told the Jews, “If this matter involved a wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to hear your complaint. \n","But since it is a dispute about words and names and your own law, settle it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of such things.” \n","And he drove them away from the judgment seat. \n   \n","At this, the crowd seized Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But none of this was of concern to Gallio. \n   \n","Paul remained in Corinth for quite some time before saying goodbye to the brothers. He had his head shaved in Cenchrea to keep a vow he had made, and then he sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. \n   \n","When they reached Ephesus, Paul parted ways with Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue there and reasoned with the Jews. \n","When they asked him to stay for a while longer, he declined. \n","But as he left, he said, “I will come back  to you if God is willing.” And he set sail from Ephesus. \n   \n","When Paul had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church at Jerusalem. Then he went down to Antioch. \n   \n","After Paul had spent some time in Antioch, he traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. \n   \n","Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the Scriptures. \n","He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and was fervent in spirit. He spoke and taught accurately about Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. \n","And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him in and explained to him the way of God more accurately. \n   \n","When Apollos resolved to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed. \n","For he powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ. \n"],["While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the interior  and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples \n","and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?” \n  “No,” they answered, “we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” \n   \n","“Into what, then, were you baptized?” Paul asked. \n  “The baptism of John,” they replied. \n   \n","Paul explained: “John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the One coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” \n   \n","On hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. \n","And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. \n","There were about twelve men in all. \n   \n","Then Paul went into the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. \n","But when some of them stubbornly refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way, Paul took his disciples and left the synagogue to conduct daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. \n","This continued for two years, so that everyone who lived in the province of Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the word of the Lord. \n   \n","God did extraordinary miracles through the hands of Paul, \n","so that even handkerchiefs  and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and the diseases and evil spirits left them. \n   \n","Now there were some itinerant Jewish exorcists who tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those with evil spirits. They would say, “I bind you by Jesus, whom Paul proclaims.” \n","Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. \n   \n","Eventually, one of the evil spirits answered them, “Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?” \n","Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. The attack was so violent that they ran out of the house naked and wounded. \n   \n","This became known to all the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, and fear came over all of them. So the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. \n","Many who had believed now came forward, confessing and disclosing their deeds. \n","And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books and burned them in front of everyone. When the value of the books was calculated, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. \n","So the word of the Lord powerfully continued to spread and prevail. \n   \n","After these things had happened, Paul resolved in the Spirit  to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia. “After I have been there,” he said, “I must see Rome as well.” \n","He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed for a time in the province of Asia. \n   \n","About that time there arose a great disturbance  about the Way. \n","It began with a silversmith named Demetrius who made silver shrines of Artemis, bringing much business  to the craftsmen. \n   \n","Demetrius assembled the craftsmen, along with the workmen in related trades. “Men,” he said, “you know that this business is our source of prosperity. \n","And you can see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in nearly the whole province of Asia, Paul has persuaded a great number of people to turn away. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all. \n","There is danger not only that our business will fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited and her majesty deposed—she who is worshiped by all the province of Asia and the whole world.” \n   \n","When the men heard this, they were enraged and began shouting, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” \n","Soon the whole city was in disarray. They rushed together into the theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia. \n   \n","Paul wanted to go before the assembly, but the disciples would not allow him. \n","Even some of Paul’s friends who were officials of the province of Asia  sent word to him, begging him not to venture into the theatre. \n   \n","Meanwhile the assembly was in turmoil. Some were shouting one thing and some another, and most of them did not even know why they were there. \n","The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander forward to explain himself, and he motioned for silence so he could make his defense to the people. \n","But when they realized that he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” \n   \n","Finally the city clerk quieted the crowd and declared, “Men of Ephesus, doesn’t everyone know that the city of Ephesus is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? \n","Since these things are undeniable, you ought to be calm and not do anything rash. \n","For you have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed our temple nor blasphemed our goddess. \n   \n","So if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open and proconsuls are available. Let them bring charges against one another there. \n","But if you are seeking anything beyond this, it must be settled in a legal assembly. \n","For we are in jeopardy of being charged with rioting for today’s events, and we have no justification to account for this commotion.” \n   \n","After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly. \n"],["When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples. And after encouraging them, he said goodbye to them and left for Macedonia. \n","After traveling through that area and speaking many words of encouragement, he arrived in Greece, \n","where he stayed three months. And when the Jews formed a plot against him as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia. \n   \n","Paul was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. \n","These men went on ahead and waited for us in Troas. \n","And after the Feast of Unleavened Bread, we sailed from Philippi, and five days later we rejoined them in Troas, where we stayed seven days. \n   \n","On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Since Paul was ready to leave the next day, he talked to them and kept on speaking until midnight. \n   \n","Now there were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered. \n","And a certain young man named Eutychus, seated in the window, was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell from the third story and was picked up dead. \n","But Paul went down, threw himself on the young man, and embraced him. “Do not be alarmed!” he said. “He is still alive!” \n   \n","Then Paul went back upstairs, broke bread, and ate. And after speaking until daybreak, he departed. \n","And the people were greatly relieved to take the boy home alive. \n   \n","We went on ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, where we were to take Paul aboard. He had arranged this because he was going there on foot. \n","And when he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene. \n","Sailing on from there, we arrived the next day opposite Chios. The day after that we arrived at Samos, and  on the following day we came to Miletus. \n   \n","Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, because he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost. \n   \n","From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church. \n   \n","When they came to him, he said, “You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I arrived in the province of Asia. \n","I served the Lord with great humility and with tears, especially in the trials that came upon me through the plots of the Jews. \n","I did not shrink back from declaring anything that was helpful to you as I taught you publicly and from house to house, \n","testifying to Jews and Greeks alike about repentance to God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. \n   \n","And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. \n","I only know that in town after town the Holy Spirit warns me that chains and afflictions await me. \n","But I consider my life of no value to me, if only I may finish my course and complete the ministry I have received from the Lord Jesus—the ministry of testifying to the good news of God’s grace. \n   \n","Now I know that none of you among whom I have preached the kingdom will see my face again. \n","Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men. \n","For I did not shrink back from declaring to you the whole will of God. \n   \n","Keep watch over yourselves and the entire flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God,  which He purchased with His own blood. \n","I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. \n","Even from your own number, men will rise up and distort the truth to draw away disciples after them. \n","Therefore be alert and remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears. \n   \n","And now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified. \n   \n","I have not coveted anyone’s silver or gold or clothing. \n","You yourselves know that these hands of mine have ministered to my own needs and those of my companions. \n","In everything, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words of the Lord Jesus Himself: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’” \n   \n","When Paul had said this, he knelt down with all of them and prayed. \n","They all wept openly as they embraced Paul and kissed him. \n","They were especially grieved by his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship. \n"],["After we had torn ourselves away from them, we sailed directly to Cos, and the next day on to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. \n","Finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we boarded it and set sail. \n","After sighting Cyprus and passing south of it, we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre, where the ship was to unload its cargo. \n   \n","We sought out the disciples in Tyre and stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit they kept telling Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. \n","But when our time there had ended, we set out on our journey. All the disciples, with their wives and children, accompanied us out of the city and knelt down on the beach to pray with us. \n","And after we had said our farewells, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home. \n   \n","When we had finished our voyage from Tyre, we landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for a day. \n   \n","Leaving the next day, we went on to Caesarea and stayed at the home of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the Seven. \n","He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied. \n   \n","After we had been there several days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. \n","Coming over to us, he took Paul’s belt, bound his own feet and hands, and said, “The Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews of Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and hand him over to the Gentiles.’” \n","When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. \n   \n","Then Paul answered, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” \n","When he would not be dissuaded, we fell silent and said, “The Lord’s will be done.” \n   \n","After these days, we packed up and went on to Jerusalem. \n","Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us, and they took us to stay at the home of Mnason the Cypriot, an early disciple. \n   \n","When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us joyfully. \n","The next day Paul went in with us to see James, and all the elders were present. \n","Paul greeted them and recounted one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. \n   \n","When they heard this, they glorified God. Then they said to Paul, “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law. \n","But they are under the impression that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or observe our customs. \n","What then should we do? They will certainly hear that you have come. \n   \n","Therefore do what we advise you. There are four men with us who have taken a vow. \n","Take these men, purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses so they can have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know that there is no truth to these rumors about you, but that you also live in obedience to the law. \n   \n","As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they must abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality.” \n   \n","So the next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he entered the temple to give notice of the date when their purification would be complete and the offering would be made for each of them. \n   \n","When the seven days were almost over, some Jews from the province of Asia  saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him, \n","crying out, “Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches everywhere against our people and against our law and against this place. Furthermore, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place.” \n","For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple. \n   \n","The whole city was stirred up, and the people rushed together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut. \n","While they were trying to kill him, the commander of the Roman regiment  received a report that all Jerusalem was in turmoil. \n","Immediately he took some soldiers and centurions and ran down to the crowd. When the people saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. \n   \n","The commander came up and arrested Paul, ordering that he be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done. \n   \n","Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, and some another. And since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks. \n","When Paul reached the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob. \n","For the crowd that followed him kept shouting, “Away with him!” \n   \n","As they were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, “May I say something to you?” \n  “Do you speak Greek?” he replied. \n","“Aren’t you the Egyptian who incited a rebellion some time ago and led four thousand members of the ‘Assassins’ into the wilderness?” \n   \n","But Paul answered, “I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Now I beg you to allow me to speak to the people.” \n   \n","Having received permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. A great hush came over the crowd, and he addressed them in Hebrew: \n"],["“Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense before you.” \n","When they heard him speak to them in Hebrew, they became even more silent. \n  Then Paul declared, \n","“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but raised in this city. I was educated at the feet of Gamaliel in strict conformity to the law of our fathers. I am just as zealous for God as any of you here today. \n   \n","I persecuted this Way even to the death, detaining both men and women and throwing them into prison, \n","as the high priest and the whole Council can testify about me. I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to apprehend these people and bring them to Jerusalem to be punished. \n   \n","About noon as I was approaching Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me. \n","I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?’ \n   \n","‘Who are You, Lord?’ I asked. \n  ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,’ He replied. \n","My companions saw the light, but they could not understand the voice of the One speaking to me. \n   \n","Then I asked, ‘What should I do, Lord?’ \n  ‘Get up and go into Damascus,’ He told me. ‘There you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.’ \n   \n","Because the brilliance of the light had blinded me, my companions led me by the hand into Damascus. \n","There a man named Ananias, a devout observer of the law who was highly regarded by all the Jews living there, \n","came and stood beside me. ‘Brother Saul,’ he said, ‘receive your sight.’ And at that moment I could see him. \n   \n","Then he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear His voice. \n","You will be His witness to everyone of what you have seen and heard. \n","And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized, and wash your sins away, calling on His name.’ \n   \n","Later, when I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance \n","and saw the Lord  saying to me, ‘Hurry! Leave Jerusalem quickly, because the people here will not accept your testimony about Me.’ \n   \n","‘Lord,’ I answered, ‘they know very well that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in You. \n","And when the blood of Your witness  Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and watching over the garments of those who killed him.’ \n   \n","Then He said to me, ‘Go! I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’” \n   \n","The crowd listened to Paul until he made this statement. Then they lifted up their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He is not fit to live!” \n   \n","As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air, \n","the commander ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks. He directed that Paul be flogged and interrogated to determine the reason for this outcry against him. \n   \n","But as they stretched him out to strap him down, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it lawful for you to flog a Roman citizen without a trial?” \n   \n","On hearing this, the centurion went and reported it to the commander. “What are you going to do?” he said. “This man is a Roman citizen.” \n   \n","The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” \n  “Yes,” he answered. \n   \n","“I paid a high price for my citizenship,” said the commander. \n  “But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied. \n   \n","Then those who were about to interrogate Paul stepped back, and the commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put a Roman citizen in chains. \n   \n","The next day the commander, wanting to learn the real reason Paul was accused by the Jews, released him and ordered the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin  to assemble. Then he brought Paul down and had him stand before them. \n"],["Paul looked directly at the Sanhedrin  and said, “Brothers, I have conducted myself before God in all good conscience to this day.” \n   \n","At this, the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. \n   \n","Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit here to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck.” \n   \n","But those standing nearby said, “How dare you insult the high priest of God!” \n   \n","“Brothers,” Paul replied, “I was not aware that he was the high priest, for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.’ ” \n   \n","Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. It is because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.” \n   \n","As soon as he had said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. \n","For the Sadducees say that there is neither a resurrection, nor angels, nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. \n   \n","A great clamor arose, and some scribes from the party of the Pharisees got up and contended sharply, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?” \n","The dispute grew so violent that the commander was afraid they would tear Paul to pieces. He ordered the soldiers to go down and remove him by force and bring him into the barracks. \n   \n","The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, “Take courage! As you have testified about Me in Jerusalem, so also you must testify in Rome.” \n   \n","When daylight came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. \n","More than forty of them were involved in this plot. \n","They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have bound ourselves with a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul. \n","Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him down to you on the pretext of examining his case more carefully. We are ready to kill him on the way.” \n   \n","But when the son of Paul’s sister heard about the plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul. \n","Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.” \n   \n","So the centurion took him to the commander and said, “Paul the prisoner sent and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.” \n   \n","The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside, and asked, “What do you need to tell me?” \n   \n","He answered, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul to the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of acquiring more information about him. \n","Do not let them persuade you, because more than forty men are waiting to ambush him. They have bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him; they are ready now, awaiting your consent.” \n   \n","So the commander dismissed the young man and instructed him, “Do not tell anyone that you have reported this to me.” \n   \n","Then he called two of his centurions and said, “Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea in the third hour of the night. \n","Provide mounts for Paul to take him safely to Governor Felix.” \n","And he wrote the following letter: \n   \n","Claudius Lysias, \n  To His Excellency, Governor Felix: \n  Greetings. \n   \n","This man was seized by the Jews, and they were about to kill him when I came with my troops to rescue him. For I had learned that he is a Roman citizen, \n","and since I wanted to understand their charges against him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin. \n","I found that the accusation involved questions about their own law, but there was no charge worthy of death or imprisonment. \n   \n","When I was informed that there was a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also instructed his accusers to present their case against him before you. \n   \n","So the soldiers followed their orders and brought Paul by night to Antipatris. \n","The next day they returned to the barracks and let the horsemen go on with him. \n","When the horsemen arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and presented Paul to him. \n   \n","The governor read the letter and asked what province Paul was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia, \n","he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers arrive.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s Praetorium. \n"],["Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a lawyer  named Tertullus, who presented to the governor their case against Paul. \n   \n","When Paul had been called in, Tertullus opened the prosecution: “Because of you, we have enjoyed a lasting peace, and your foresight has brought improvements to this nation. \n","In every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with all gratitude. \n","But in order not to burden you any further, I beg your indulgence to hear us briefly. \n   \n","We have found this man to be a pestilence, stirring up dissension among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes, \n","and he even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him. \n",null,"By examining him yourself, you will be able to learn the truth about all our charges against him.” \n   \n","The Jews concurred, asserting that these charges were true. \n   \n","When the governor motioned for Paul to speak, he began his response: “Knowing that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly make my defense. \n","You can verify for yourself that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. \n","Yet my accusers did not find me debating with anyone in the temple or riling up a crowd in the synagogues or in the city. \n","Nor can they prove to you any of their charges against me. \n   \n","I do confess to you, however, that I worship the God of our fathers according to the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets, \n","and I have the same hope in God that they themselves cherish, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. \n","In this hope, I strive always to maintain a clear conscience before God and man. \n   \n","After several years, then, I returned to Jerusalem to bring alms to my people and to present offerings. \n","At the time they found me in the temple, I was ceremonially clean and was not inciting a crowd or an uproar. But there are some Jews from the province of Asia  \n","who ought to appear before you and bring charges, if they have anything against me. \n","Otherwise, let these men state for themselves any crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin, \n","unless it was this one thing I called out as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’” \n   \n","Then Felix, who was well informed about the Way, adjourned the hearing and said, “When Lysias the commander comes, I will decide your case.” \n","He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard, but to allow him some freedom and permit his friends to minister to his needs. \n   \n","After several days, Felix returned with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ Jesus. \n","As Paul expounded on righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and said, “You may go for now. When I find the time, I will call for you.” \n","At the same time, he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe. So he sent for Paul frequently and talked with him. \n   \n"],["Three days after his arrival in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem, \n","where the chief priests and Jewish leaders presented their case against Paul. They urged Festus \n","to grant them a concession against Paul by summoning him to Jerusalem, because they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way. \n   \n","But Festus replied, “Paul is being held in Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon. \n","So if this man has done anything wrong, let some of your leaders come down with me and accuse him there.” \n   \n","After spending no more than eight or ten days with them, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered that Paul be brought in. \n","When Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges that they could not prove. \n   \n","Then Paul made his defense: “I have committed no offense against the law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar.” \n   \n","But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to stand trial before me on these charges?” \n   \n","Paul replied, “I am standing before the judgment seat of Caesar, where I ought to be tried. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well. \n","If, however, I am guilty of anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is no truth to their accusations against me, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!” \n   \n","Then Festus conferred with his council and replied, “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!” \n   \n","After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus. \n","Since they were staying several days, Festus laid out Paul’s case before the king: “There is a certain man whom Felix left in prison. \n","While I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews presented their case and requested a judgment against him. \n","I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand a man over before he has had an opportunity to face his accusers and defend himself against their charges. \n   \n","So when they came here with me, I did not delay. The next day I sat on the judgment seat and ordered that the man be brought in. \n","But when his accusers rose to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected. \n","They only had some contentions with him regarding their own religion and a certain Jesus who had died, but whom Paul affirmed to be alive. \n   \n","Since I was at a loss as to how to investigate these matters, I asked if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges. \n","But when Paul appealed to be held over for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered that he be held until I could send him to Caesar.” \n   \n","Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear this man myself.” \n  “Tomorrow you will hear him,” Festus declared. \n   \n","The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the auditorium, along with the commanders and leading men of the city. And Festus ordered that Paul be brought in. \n   \n","Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man. The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him, both here and in Jerusalem, crying out that he ought not to live any longer. \n","But I found he had done nothing worthy of death, and since he has now appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him. \n   \n","I have nothing definite to write to our sovereign one about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this inquiry I may have something to write. \n","For it seems unreasonable to me to send on a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.” \n"],["Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” \n  Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense: \n","“King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today to defend myself against all the accusations of the Jews, \n","especially since you are acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. I beg you, therefore, to listen to me patiently. \n   \n","Surely all the Jews know how I have lived from the earliest days of my youth, among my own people and in Jerusalem. \n","They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that I lived as a Pharisee, adhering to the strictest sect of our religion. \n   \n","And now I stand on trial because of my hope in the promise that God made to our fathers, \n","the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to realize as they earnestly serve God day and night. It is because of this hope, O king, that I am accused by the Jews. \n","Why would any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead? \n   \n","So then, I too was convinced that I ought to do all I could to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. \n","And that is what I did in Jerusalem. With authority from the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they were condemned to death, I cast my vote against them. \n","I frequently had them punished in the synagogues, and I tried to make them blaspheme. In my raging fury against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them. \n   \n","In this pursuit I was on my way to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. \n","About noon, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and my companions. \n","We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice say to me in Hebrew, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’ \n   \n","‘Who are You, Lord?’ I asked. \n  ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,’ the Lord replied. \n","‘But get up and stand on your feet. For I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen from Me and what I will show you. \n","I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them \n","to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those sanctified by faith in Me.’ \n   \n","So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. \n","First to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, then to everyone in the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I declared that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds worthy of their repentance. \n","For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple courts  and tried to kill me. \n   \n","But I have had God’s help to this day, and I stand here to testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen: \n","that the Christ would suffer, and as the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles.” \n   \n","At this stage of Paul’s defense, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice, “You are insane, Paul! Your great learning is driving you to madness!” \n   \n","But Paul answered, “I am not insane, most excellent Festus; I am speaking words of truth and sobriety. \n","For the king knows about these matters, and I can speak freely to him. I am confident that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner. \n","King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.” \n   \n","Then Agrippa said to Paul, “Can you persuade me in such a short time to become a Christian?” \n   \n","“Short time or long,” Paul replied, “I wish to God that not only you but all who hear me this day may become what I am, except for these chains.” \n   \n","Then the king and the governor rose, along with Bernice and those seated with them. \n","On their way out, they said to one another, “This man has done nothing worthy of death or imprisonment.” \n   \n","And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.” \n"],["When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial  Regiment. \n","We boarded an Adramyttian ship about to sail for ports along the coast of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us. \n   \n","The next day we landed at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul with consideration, allowing him to visit his friends and receive their care. \n","After putting out from there, we sailed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us. \n","And when we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia. \n","There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board. \n   \n","After sailing slowly for many days, we arrived off Cnidus. When the wind impeded us, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. \n","After we had moved along the coast with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea. \n   \n","By now much time had passed, and the voyage had already become dangerous because it was after the Fast. So Paul advised them, \n","“Men, I can see that our voyage will be filled with disaster and great loss, not only to ship and cargo, but to our own lives as well.” \n   \n","But contrary to Paul’s advice, the centurion was persuaded by the pilot and by the owner of the ship. \n","Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided to sail on, if somehow they could reach Phoenix to winter there. Phoenix was a harbor in Crete facing both southwest and northwest. \n   \n","When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had their opportunity. So they weighed anchor and sailed along, hugging the coast of Crete. \n","But it was not long before a cyclone called the Northeaster swept down across the island. \n","Unable to head into the wind, the ship was caught up. So we gave way and let ourselves be driven along. \n   \n","Passing to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we barely managed to secure the lifeboat. \n","After hoisting it up, the crew used ropes to undergird the ship. And fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor  and were driven along. \n   \n","We were tossed so violently that the next day the men began to jettison the cargo. \n","On the third day, they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands. \n","When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the great storm continued to batter us, we abandoned all hope of being saved. \n   \n","After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have followed my advice not to sail from Crete. Then you would have averted this disaster and loss. \n","But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because you will not experience any loss of life, but only of the ship. \n","For just last night an angel of God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood beside me \n","and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And look, God has granted you the lives of all who sail with you.’ \n   \n","So take courage, men, for I believe God that it will happen just as He told me. \n","However, we must run aground on some island.” \n   \n","On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea. About midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land. \n","They took soundings and found that the water was twenty fathoms deep.  Going a little farther, they took another set of soundings that read fifteen fathoms. \n","Fearing that we would run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daybreak. \n   \n","Meanwhile, the sailors attempted to escape from the ship. Pretending to lower anchors from the bow, they let the lifeboat down into the sea. \n","But Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain with the ship, you cannot be saved.” \n","So the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat and set it adrift. \n   \n","Right up to daybreak, Paul kept urging them all to eat: “Today is your fourteenth day in constant suspense, without taking any food. \n","So for your own preservation, I urge you to eat something, because not a single hair of your head will be lost.” \n   \n","After he had said this, Paul took bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat. \n","They were all encouraged and took some food themselves. \n","In all, there were 276  of us on board. \n","After the men had eaten their fill, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea. \n   \n","When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they sighted a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could. \n","Cutting away the anchors, they left them in the sea as they loosened the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. \n","But the vessel struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was being broken up by the pounding of the waves. \n   \n","The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners so none of them could swim to freedom. \n","But the centurion, wanting to spare Paul’s life, thwarted their plan. He commanded those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. \n","The rest were to follow on planks and various parts of the ship. In this way everyone was brought safely to land. \n"],["Once we were safely ashore, we learned that the island was called Malta. \n","The islanders showed us extraordinary kindness. They kindled a fire and welcomed all of us because it was raining and cold. \n   \n","Paul gathered a bundle of sticks, and as he laid them on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself to his hand. \n","When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “Surely this man is a murderer. Although he was saved from the sea, Justice  has not allowed him to live.” \n","But Paul shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no ill effects. \n","The islanders were expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. But after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god. \n   \n","Nearby stood an estate belonging to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days. \n","The father of Publius was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him, and after praying and placing his hands on him, he healed the man. \n","After this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured as well. \n   \n","The islanders honored us in many ways and supplied our needs when we were ready to sail. \n   \n","After three months we set sail in an Alexandrian ship that had wintered in the island. It had the Twin Brothers  as a figurehead. \n","Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there three days. \n","From there we weighed anchor and came to Rhegium. After one day, a south wind came up, and on the second day we arrived at Puteoli. \n","There we found some brothers who invited us to spend the week with them. And so we came to Rome. \n   \n","The brothers there had heard about us and traveled as far as the Forum of Appius   and the Three Taverns  to meet us. When Paul saw them, he was encouraged and gave thanks to God. \n   \n","When we arrived in Rome, Paul was permitted to stay by himself, with a soldier to guard him. \n   \n","After three days, he called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had gathered, he said to them, “Brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, I was taken prisoner in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans. \n","They examined me and wanted to release me, because there was no basis for a death sentence against me. \n","But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, even though I have no charge to bring against my nation. \n","So for this reason I have called to see you and speak with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.” \n   \n","The leaders replied, “We have not received any letters about you from Judea, nor have any of the brothers from there reported or even mentioned anything bad about you. \n","But we consider your views worth hearing, because we know that people everywhere are speaking against this sect.” \n   \n","So they set a day to meet with Paul, and many people came to the place he was staying. He expounded to them from morning to evening, testifying about the kingdom of God and persuading them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and the Prophets. \n   \n","Some of them were convinced by what he said, but others refused to believe. \n","They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: “The Holy Spirit was right when He spoke to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet: \n   \n","‘Go to this people and say, \n “You will be ever hearing but never understanding; \n you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.” \n  \n","For this people’s heart has grown callous; \n they hardly hear with their ears, \n and they have closed their eyes. \n Otherwise they might see with their eyes, \n hear with their ears, \n understand with their hearts, \n and turn, and I would heal them.’ \n   \n","Be advised, therefore, that God’s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!” \n   \n",null,"Paul stayed there two full years in his own rented house, welcoming all who came to visit him. \n"]],"Romans":[["Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God—\n","the gospel He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, \n","regarding His Son, who was a descendant of David according to the flesh, \n","and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by His resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord. \n   \n","Through Him and on behalf of His name, we received grace and apostleship to call all those among the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith. \n","And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ. \n   \n","To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: \n  Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n   \n","First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed all over the world. \n","God, whom I serve with my spirit  in preaching the gospel of His Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you \n","in my prayers at all times, asking that now at last by God’s will I may succeed in coming to you. \n","For I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, \n","that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith. \n   \n","I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, how often I planned to come to you (but have been prevented from visiting  until now), in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles. \n","I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish. \n","That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome. \n   \n","I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, then to the Greek. \n","For the gospel reveals the righteousness of God that comes by faith from start to finish,  just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.” \n   \n","The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness. \n","For what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. \n","For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood from His workmanship, so that men are without excuse. \n   \n","For although they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but they became futile in their thinking and darkened in their foolish hearts. \n","Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools, \n","and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images of mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. \n   \n","Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to impurity for the dishonoring of their bodies with one another. \n","They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is forever worthy of praise! Amen. \n   \n","For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. \n","Likewise, the men abandoned natural relations with women and burned with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. \n   \n","Furthermore, since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, He gave them up to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. \n","They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice. They are gossips, \n","slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, and boastful. They invent new forms of evil; they disobey their parents. \n","They are senseless, faithless, heartless, merciless. \n   \n","Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things are worthy of death, they not only continue to do these things, but also approve of those who practice them. \n"],["You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on another. For on whatever grounds you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. \n","And we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. \n","So when you, O man, pass judgment on others, yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment? \n","Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance? \n   \n","But because of your hard and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed. \n","God “will repay each one according to his deeds.” \n","To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life. \n","But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow wickedness, there will be wrath and anger. \n   \n","There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil, first for the Jew, then for the Greek; \n","but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, first for the Jew, then for the Greek. \n","For God does not show favoritism. \n   \n","All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. \n","For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be declared righteous. \n   \n","Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. \n","So they show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or defending them \n","on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Christ Jesus, as proclaimed by my gospel. \n   \n","Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God; \n","if you know His will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law; \n","if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness, \n","an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—\n","you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal? \n","You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? \n","You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? \n","As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.” \n   \n","Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. \n","If a man who is not circumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? \n","The one who is physically uncircumcised yet keeps the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker. \n   \n","A man is not a Jew because he is one outwardly, nor is circumcision only outward and physical. \n","No, a man is a Jew because he is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man’s praise does not come from men, but from God. \n"],["What, then, is the advantage of being a Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? \n","Much in every way. First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words  of God. \n   \n","What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God’s faithfulness? \n","Certainly not! Let God be true and every man a liar. As it is written: \n  “So that You may be proved right when You speak \n and victorious when You judge.” \n   \n","But if our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to inflict His wrath on us? I am speaking in human terms. \n","Certainly not! In that case, how could God judge the world? \n","However, if my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner? \n","Why not say, as some slanderously claim that we say, “Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is deserved! \n   \n","What then? Are we any better? Not at all. For we have already made the charge that Jews and Greeks alike are all under sin. \n","As it is written: \n  “There is no one righteous, \n not even one. \n  \n","There is no one who understands, \n no one who seeks God. \n  \n","All have turned away, \n they have together become worthless; \n there is no one who does good, \n not even one.” \n  \n","“Their throats are open graves; \n their tongues practice deceit.” \n “The venom of vipers is on their lips.” \n  \n","“Their mouths are full \n of cursing and bitterness.” \n  \n","“Their feet are swift to shed blood; \n  \n","ruin and misery lie in their wake, \n  \n","and the way of peace they have not known.” \n  \n","“There is no fear of God \n before their eyes.” \n   \n","Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. \n","Therefore no one will be justified in His sight by works of the law. For the law merely brings awareness of sin. \n   \n","But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, as attested by the Law and the Prophets. \n","And this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no distinction, \n","for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, \n","and are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. \n   \n","God presented Him as the atoning sacrifice  through faith in His blood, in order to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance He had passed over the sins committed beforehand. \n","He did this to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and to justify the one who has faith in Jesus. \n   \n","Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of works? No, but on that of faith. \n","For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law. \n   \n","Is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, \n","since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith. \n   \n","Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Certainly not! Instead, we uphold the law. \n"],["What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, has discovered? \n","If Abraham was indeed justified by works, he had something to boast about, but not before God. \n","For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” \n   \n","Now the wages of the worker are not credited as a gift, but as an obligation. \n","However, to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness. \n","And David speaks likewise of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: \n   \n","“Blessed are they whose lawless acts are forgiven, \n whose sins are covered. \n  \n","Blessed is the man \n whose sin the Lord will never count against him.” \n   \n","Is this blessing only on the circumcised, or also on the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness. \n","In what context was it credited? Was it after his circumcision, or before? It was not after, but before. \n   \n","And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but are not circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them. \n","And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. \n   \n","For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world was not given through the law, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. \n","For if those who live by the law are heirs, faith is useless and the promise is worthless, \n","because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law, there is no transgression. \n   \n","Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may rest on grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all. \n","As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our father in the presence of God, in whom he believed, the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not yet exist. \n   \n","Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.” \n","Without weakening in his faith, he acknowledged the decrepitness of his body (since he was about a hundred years old) and the lifelessness of Sarah’s womb. \n","Yet he did not waver through disbelief in the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, \n","being fully persuaded that God was able to do what He had promised. \n","This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” \n   \n","Now the words “it was credited to him” were written not only for Abraham, \n","but also for us, to whom righteousness will be credited—for us who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. \n","He was delivered over to death for our trespasses and was raised to life for our justification. \n"],["Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have  peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, \n","through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we stand. And we rejoice  in the hope of the glory of God. \n   \n","Not only that, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; \n","perseverance, character; and character, hope. \n","And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out His love into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us. \n   \n","For at just the right time, while we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. \n","Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die. \n","But God proves His love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. \n   \n","Therefore, since we have now been justified by His blood, how much more shall we be saved from wrath through Him! \n","For if, when we were enemies of God, we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through His life! \n","Not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. \n   \n","Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death was passed on to all men, because all sinned. \n","For sin was in the world before the law was given; but sin is not taken into account when there is no law. \n","Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who did not sin in the way that Adam transgressed. He is a pattern of the One to come. \n   \n","But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many! \n","Again, the gift is not like the result of the one man’s sin: The judgment that followed one sin brought condemnation, but the gift that followed many trespasses brought justification. \n","For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive an abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ! \n   \n","So then, just as one trespass brought condemnation for all men, so also one act of righteousness brought justification and life for all men. \n","For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. \n   \n","The law came in so that the trespass would increase; but where sin increased, grace increased all the more, \n","so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. \n"],["What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may increase? \n","Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer? \n","Or aren’t you aware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? \n","We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life. \n   \n","For if we have been united with Him like this in His death, we will certainly also be united with Him in His resurrection. \n","We know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, that we should no longer be slaves to sin. \n","For anyone who has died has been freed from sin. \n   \n","Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him. \n","For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, He cannot die again; death no longer has dominion over Him. \n","The death He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life He lives, He lives to God. \n","So you too must count yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. \n   \n","Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires. \n","Do not present the parts of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and present the parts of your body to Him as instruments of righteousness. \n","For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace. \n   \n","What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Certainly not! \n","Do you not know that when you offer yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves to the one you obey, whether you are slaves to sin leading to death, or to obedience leading to righteousness? \n","But thanks be to God that, though you once were slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were committed. \n","You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness. \n   \n","I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to escalating wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness. \n   \n","For when you were slaves to sin, you were free of obligation to righteousness. \n","What fruit did you reap at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The outcome of those things is death. \n","But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the fruit you reap leads to holiness, and the outcome is eternal life. \n","For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. \n"],["Do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives? \n","For instance, a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage. \n","So then, if she is joined to another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law and is not an adulteress, even if she marries another man. \n   \n","Therefore, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God. \n","For when we lived according to the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, bearing fruit for death. \n","But now, having died to what bound us, we have been released from the law, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code. \n   \n","What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed, I would not have been mindful of sin if not for the law. For I would not have been aware of coveting if the law had not said, “Do not covet.” \n","But sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from the law, sin is dead. \n   \n","Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. \n","So I discovered that the very commandment that was meant to bring life actually brought death. \n","For sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through the commandment put me to death. \n   \n","So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good. \n   \n","Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Certainly not! But in order that sin might be exposed as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful. \n   \n","We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. \n","I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do. But what I hate, I do. \n","And if I do what I do not want to do, I admit that the law is good. \n","In that case, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. \n   \n","I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh; for I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. \n","For I do not do the good I want to do. Instead, I keep on doing the evil I do not want to do. \n","And if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. \n   \n","So this is the principle I have discovered: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. \n","For in my inner being I delight in God’s law. \n","But I see another law at work in my body, warring against the law of my mind and holding me captive to the law of sin that dwells within me. \n   \n","What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? \n","Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord! \n  So then, with my mind I serve the law of God, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin. \n"],["Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. \n","For in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set you  free from the law of sin and death. \n","For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful man, as an offering for sin. He thus condemned sin in the flesh, \n","so that the righteous standard of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. \n   \n","Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh; but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. \n","The mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace, \n","because the mind of the flesh is hostile to God: It does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so. \n","Those controlled by the flesh  cannot please God. \n   \n","You, however, are controlled not by the flesh, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. \n","But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive  because of righteousness. \n","And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead  will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit, who lives in you. \n   \n","Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation, but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it. \n","For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. \n","For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. \n   \n","For you did not receive a spirit of slavery that returns you to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” \n","The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. \n","And if we are children, then we are heirs: heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with Him, so that we may also be glorified with Him. \n   \n","I consider that our present sufferings are not comparable to the glory that will be revealed in us. \n","The creation waits in eager expectation for the revelation of the sons of God. \n","For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will, but because of the One who subjected it, in hope \n","that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. \n   \n","We know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until the present time. \n","Not only that, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. \n","For in this hope we were saved; but hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he can already see? \n","But if we hope for what we do not yet see, we wait for it patiently. \n   \n","In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know how we ought to pray, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groans too deep for words. \n","And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. \n   \n","And we know that God works all things together for the good of those who love Him, who are called according to His purpose. \n","For those God foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brothers. \n","And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified. \n   \n","What then shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? \n","He who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also, along with Him, freely give us all things? \n","Who will bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. \n","Who is there to condemn us? For Christ Jesus, who died, and more than that was raised to life, is at the right hand of God—and He is interceding for us. \n   \n","Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? \n","As it is written: \n  “For Your sake we face death all day long; \n we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.” \n   \n","No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. \n","For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor principalities, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, \n","neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. \n"],["I speak the truth in Christ; I am not lying, as confirmed by my conscience in the Holy Spirit. \n","I have deep sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. \n","For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my own flesh and blood, \n","the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory and the covenants; theirs the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises. \n","Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them proceeds the human descent of Christ, who is God over all, forever worthy of praise! Amen. \n   \n","It is not as though God’s word has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. \n","Nor because they are Abraham’s descendants are they all his children. On the contrary, “Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.” \n","So it is not the children of the flesh who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as offspring. \n","For this is what the promise stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.” \n   \n","Not only that, but Rebecca’s children were conceived by one man, our father Isaac. \n","Yet before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God’s plan of election might stand, \n","not by works but by Him who calls, she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” \n","So it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” \n   \n","What then shall we say? Is God unjust?

In fact, I do not even judge myself. \n","My conscience is clear, but that does not vindicate me. It is the Lord who judges me. \n   \n","Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men’s hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God. \n   \n","Brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written. Then you will not take pride in one man over another. \n","For who makes you so superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not? \n   \n","Already you have all you want. Already you have become rich. Without us, you have become kings. How I wish you really were kings, so that we might be kings with you! \n","For it seems to me that God has displayed us apostles at the end of the procession, like prisoners appointed for death. We have become a spectacle to the whole world, to angels as well as to men. \n   \n","We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong.

When we are vilified, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it; \n","when we are slandered, we answer gently.

Therefore glorify God with your body. \n"],["Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good to abstain from sexual relations. \n","But because there is so much sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. \n   \n","The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. \n","The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife. \n   \n","Do not deprive each other, except by mutual consent and for a time, so you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again, so that Satan will not tempt you through your lack of self-control. \n","I say this as a concession, not as a command. \n","I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. \n   \n","Now to the unmarried and widows I say this: It is good for them to remain unmarried, as I am. \n","But if they cannot control themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion. \n   \n","To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. \n","But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. \n   \n","To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If a brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. \n","And if a woman has an unbelieving husband and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. \n","For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. \n   \n","But if the unbeliever leaves, let him go. The believing brother or sister is not bound in such cases. God has called you  to live in peace. \n","How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? \n   \n","Regardless, each one should lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is what I prescribe in all the churches. \n","Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man still uncircumcised when called? He should not be circumcised. \n","Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commandments is what counts. \n   \n","Each one should remain in the situation he was in when he was called. \n","Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let it concern you—but if you can gain your freedom, take the opportunity. \n","For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord’s freedman. Conversely, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ’s slave. \n   \n","You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. \n","Brothers, each one should remain in the situation he was in when God called him. \n   \n","Now about virgins, I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. \n","Because of the present  crisis, I think it is good for a man to remain as he is. \n","Are you committed to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you free of commitment? Do not look for a wife. \n","But if you do marry, you have not sinned. And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. \n   \n","What I am saying, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none; \n","those who weep, as if they did not; those who are joyful, as if they were not; those who make a purchase, as if they had nothing; \n","and those who use the things of this world, as if not dependent on them. For this world in its present form is passing away. \n   \n","I want you to be free from concern. The unmarried man is concerned about the work of the Lord, how he can please the Lord. \n","But the married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, how he can please his wife, \n","and his interests are divided. The unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the work of the Lord, how she can be holy in both body and spirit. But the married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, how she can please her husband. \n   \n","I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but in order to promote proper decorum and undivided devotion to the Lord. \n   \n","However, if someone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his betrothed, and if she is beyond her youth and they ought to marry, let him do as he wishes; he is not sinning; they should get married. \n","But the man who is firmly established in his heart and under no constraint, with control over his will and resolve in his heart not to marry the virgin, he will do well. \n   \n","So then, he who marries the virgin does well, but he who does not marry her does even better. \n   \n","A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, as long as he belongs to the Lord. \n","In my judgment, however, she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I too have the Spirit of God. \n"],["Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. \n","The one who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know. \n","But the one who loves God is known by God. \n   \n","So about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world, and that there is no God but one. \n","For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many so-called gods and lords), \n","yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we exist. And there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we exist. \n   \n","But not everyone has this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that they eat such food as if it were sacrificed to an idol. And since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. \n","But food does not bring us closer to God: We are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do. \n   \n","Be careful, however, that your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak. \n","For if someone with a weak conscience sees you who are well informed eating in an idol’s temple, will he not be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols? \n","So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. \n","By sinning against your brothers in this way and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. \n   \n","Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to stumble. \n"],["Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you yourselves not my workmanship in the Lord? \n","Even if I am not an apostle to others, surely I am to you.

Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not drink of its milk? \n   \n","Do I say this from a human perspective? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing? \n","For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it about oxen that God is concerned? \n","Isn’t He actually speaking on our behalf? Indeed, this was written for us, because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes, they should also expect to share in the harvest. \n   \n","If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much for us to reap a material harvest from you? \n","If others have this right to your support, shouldn’t we have it all the more? But we did not exercise this right. Instead, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ. \n   \n","Do you not know that those who work in the temple eat of its food, and those who serve at the altar partake of its offerings? \n","In the same way, the Lord has prescribed that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel. \n","But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this to suggest that something be done for me. Indeed, I would rather die than let anyone nullify my boast. \n   \n","Yet when I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because I am obligated to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! \n","If my preaching is voluntary, I have a reward. But if it is not voluntary, I am still entrusted with a responsibility. \n","What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not use up my rights in preaching it. \n   \n","Though I am free of obligation to anyone, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. \n","To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), to win those under the law. \n","To those without the law I became like one without the law (though I am not outside the law of God but am under the law of Christ), to win those without the law. \n","To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some. \n   \n","I do all this for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings. \n   \n","Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way as to take the prize. \n","Everyone who competes in the games trains with strict discipline. They do it for a crown that is perishable, but we do it for a crown that is imperishable. \n","Therefore I do not run aimlessly; I do not fight like I am beating the air. \n","No, I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified. \n"],["I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud, and that they all passed through the sea. \n","They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. \n","They all ate the same spiritual food \n","and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. \n","Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness. \n   \n","These things took place as examples to keep us from craving evil things as they did. \n","Do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written: “The people sat down to eat and to drink, and got up to indulge in revelry.” \n","We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died. \n","We should not test Christ, as some of them did, and were killed by snakes. \n","And do not complain, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel. \n   \n","Now these things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come. \n","So the one who thinks he is standing firm should be careful not to fall. \n","No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide an escape, so that you can stand up under it. \n   \n","Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. \n","I speak to reasonable people; judge for yourselves what I say. \n","Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? \n","Because there is one loaf, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf. \n   \n","Consider the people of Israel: Are not those who eat the sacrifices fellow partakers in the altar? \n","Am I suggesting, then, that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? \n","No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God.

What can I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? No, I will not! \n   \n","For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread, \n","and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” \n","In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” \n","For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes. \n   \n","Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the  body and blood of the Lord. \n","Each one must examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. \n","For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body  eats and drinks judgment on himself. \n","That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. \n   \n","Now if we judged ourselves properly, we would not come under judgment. \n","But when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. \n   \n","So, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. \n","If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you come together it will not result in judgment.

And although its parts are many, they all form one body. So it is with Christ. \n","For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free, and we were all given one Spirit to drink. \n   \n","For the body does not consist of one part, but of many. \n","If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. \n","And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. \n","If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be?

I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. \n","Otherwise, if you speak a blessing in spirit, how can someone who is uninstructed say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying? \n","You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other one is not edified. \n   \n","I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. \n","But in the church, I would rather speak five coherent words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue. \n   \n","Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature. \n","It is written in the Law: \n  “By strange tongues and foreign lips \n I will speak to this people, \n but even then they will not listen to Me, \n says the Lord.” \n   \n","Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers. \n   \n","So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who are uninstructed or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds? \n","But if an unbeliever or uninstructed person comes in while everyone is prophesying, he will be convicted and called to account by all, \n","and the secrets of his heart will be made known. So he will fall facedown and worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among you!” \n   \n","What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a psalm or a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. All of these must be done to build up the church. \n   \n","If anyone speaks in a tongue, two, or at most three, should speak in turn, and someone must interpret. \n","But if there is no interpreter, he should remain silent in the church and speak only to himself and God. \n   \n","Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. \n","And if a revelation comes to someone who is seated, the first speaker should stop. \n","For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. \n","The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. \n","For God is not a God of disorder, but of peace—as in all the churches of the saints. \n   \n","Women are to be silent in the churches. They are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. \n","If they wish to inquire about something, they are to ask their own husbands at home; for it is dishonorable for a woman to speak in the church. \n   \n","Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached? \n","If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, let him acknowledge that what I am writing you is the Lord’s command. \n","But if anyone ignores this, he himself will be ignored. \n   \n","So, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. \n","But everything must be done in a proper and orderly manner. \n"],["Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, and in which you stand firm. \n","By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. \n   \n","For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, \n","that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, \n","and that He appeared to Cephas  and then to the Twelve. \n","After that, He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. \n","Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles. \n","And last of all He appeared to me also, as to one of untimely birth. \n   \n","For I am the least of the apostles and am unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. \n","But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace to me was not in vain. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. \n","Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed. \n   \n","But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? \n","If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. \n","And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is worthless, and so is your faith. \n","In that case, we are also exposed as false witnesses about God. For we have testified about God that He raised Christ from the dead, but He did not raise Him if in fact the dead are not raised. \n   \n","For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised. \n","And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. \n","Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. \n","If our hope in Christ is for this life alone, we are to be pitied more than all men. \n   \n","But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. \n","For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. \n","For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. \n","But each in his own turn: Christ the firstfruits; then at His coming, those who belong to Him. \n   \n","Then the end will come, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed all dominion, authority, and power. \n","For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. \n","The last enemy to be destroyed is death. \n","For “God has put everything under His feet.” Now when it says that everything has been put under Him, this clearly does not include the One who put everything under Him. \n","And when all things have been subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will be made subject to Him who put all things under Him, so that God may be all in all. \n   \n","If these things are not so, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? \n","And why do we endanger ourselves every hour? \n","I face death every day, brothers, as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord. \n","If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for human motives, what did I gain? If the dead are not raised, \n  “Let us eat and drink, \n for tomorrow we die.” \n   \n","Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good character.” \n","Sober up as you ought, and stop sinning; for some of you are ignorant of God. I say this to your shame. \n   \n","But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?” \n","You fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. \n","And what you sow is not the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or something else. \n","But God gives it a body as He has designed, and to each kind of seed He gives its own body. \n   \n","Not all flesh is the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another, and fish another. \n","There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the splendor of the heavenly bodies is of one degree, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is of another. \n","The sun has one degree of splendor, the moon another, and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor. \n   \n","So will it be with the resurrection of the dead: What is sown is perishable; it is raised imperishable. \n","It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. \n","It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. \n","So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being;” the last Adam a life-giving spirit. \n   \n","The spiritual, however, was not first, but the natural, and then the spiritual. \n","The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. \n","As was the earthly man, so also are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven. \n","And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so also shall we bear the likeness of the heavenly man. \n   \n","Now I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. \n   \n","Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—\n","in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. \n","For the perishable must be clothed  with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. \n   \n","When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable and the mortal with immortality,  then the saying that is written will come to pass: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.” \n   \n","“Where, O Death, is your victory? \n Where, O Death, is your sting?” \n   \n","The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. \n","But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ! \n   \n","Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast and immovable. Always excel in the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain. \n"],["Now about the collection for the saints, you are to do as I directed the churches of Galatia: \n","On the first day of every week, each of you should set aside a portion of his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will be needed. \n","Then, on my arrival, I will send letters with those you recommend to carry your gift to Jerusalem. \n","And if it is advisable for me to go also, they can travel with me. \n   \n","After I go through Macedonia, however, I will come to you; for I will be going through Macedonia. \n","Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go. \n","For I do not want to see you now only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. \n","But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, \n","because a great door for effective work has opened to me, even though many oppose me. \n   \n","If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am. \n","No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he can return to me, for I am expecting him along with the brothers. \n   \n","Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was not at all inclined to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity. \n   \n","Be on the alert. Stand firm in the faith. Be men of courage. Be strong. \n","Do everything in love. \n   \n","You know that Stephanas and his household were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. Now I urge you, brothers, \n","to submit to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer. \n   \n","I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you. \n","For they refreshed my spirit and yours as well. Show your appreciation, therefore, to such men. \n   \n","The churches in the province of Asia  send you greetings. \n  Aquila and Prisca  greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house. \n   \n","All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. \n   \n","This greeting is in my own hand—Paul. \n   \n","If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be under a curse. Come, O Lord! \n   \n","The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. \n   \n","My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. \n  Amen."]],"II Corinthians":[["Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, \n  To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia: \n   \n","Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n   \n","Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, \n","who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God. \n","For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so also through Christ our comfort overflows. \n   \n","If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which accomplishes in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we experience. \n","And our hope for you is sure, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you will share in our comfort. \n   \n","We do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the hardships we encountered in the province of Asia. We were under a burden far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life. \n","Indeed, we felt we were under the sentence of death, in order that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead. \n   \n","He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and He will deliver us. In Him we have placed our hope that He will yet again deliver us, \n","as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the favor shown us in answer to their prayers. \n   \n","And this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in relation to you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God—not in worldly  wisdom, but in the grace of God. \n","For we do not write you anything that is beyond your ability to read and understand. And I hope that you will understand us completely, \n","as you have already understood us in part, so that you may boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of our Lord Jesus. \n   \n","Confident of this, I planned to visit you first, so that you might receive a double blessing. \n","I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to return to you from Macedonia, and then to have you help me on my way to Judea. \n   \n","When I planned this, did I do it carelessly? Or do I make my plans by human standards, so as to say “Yes, yes” when I really mean “No, no”? \n","But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.” \n","For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed among you by me and Silvanus  and Timothy, was not “Yes” and “No,” but in Him it has always been “Yes.” \n","For all the promises of God are “Yes” in Christ. And so through Him, our “Amen” is spoken to the glory of God. \n   \n","Now it is God who establishes both us and you in Christ. He anointed us, \n","placed His seal on us, and put His Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of what is to come. \n","I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth. \n","Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers with you for your joy, because it is by faith that you stand firm. \n"],["So I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you. \n","For if I grieve you, who is left to cheer me but those whom I have grieved? \n","I wrote as I did so that on my arrival I would not be saddened by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would share my joy. \n","For through many tears I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart, not to grieve you but to let you know how much I love you. \n   \n","Now if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me but all of you—to some degree, not to overstate it. \n","The punishment imposed on him by the majority is sufficient for him. \n","So instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. \n","Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him. \n   \n","My purpose in writing you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything. \n","If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And if I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven it in the presence of Christ for your sake, \n","in order that Satan should not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes. \n   \n","Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and a door stood open for me in the Lord, \n","I had no peace in my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia. \n   \n","But thanks be to God, who always leads us triumphantly as captives in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of Him. \n","For we are to God the sweet aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. \n","To the one, we are an odor of death and demise; to the other, a fragrance that brings life. And who is qualified for such a task? \n   \n","For we are not like so many others, who peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as men sent from God. \n"],["Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you? \n","You yourselves are our letter, inscribed on our hearts, known and read by everyone. \n","It is clear that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. \n   \n","Such confidence before God is ours through Christ. \n","Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim that anything comes from us, but our competence comes from God. \n","And He has qualified us as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. \n   \n","Now if the ministry of death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at the face of Moses because of its fleeting glory, \n","will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? \n","For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry of righteousness! \n","Indeed, what was once glorious has no glory now in comparison to the glory that surpasses it. \n","For if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which endures! \n   \n","Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold. \n","We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of what was fading away. \n   \n","But their minds were closed. For to this day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant. It has not been lifted, because only in Christ can it be removed. \n","And even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. \n","But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. \n   \n","Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. \n","And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into His image with intensifying glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit. \n"],["Therefore, since God in His mercy has given us this ministry, we do not lose heart. \n","Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful ways. We do not practice deceit, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by open proclamation of the truth, we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. \n","And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. \n   \n","The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. \n","For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake. \n","For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,”  made His light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. \n   \n","Now we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this surpassingly great power is from God and not from us. \n","We are hard pressed on all sides, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; \n","persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed. \n   \n","We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. \n","For we who are alive are always consigned to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal body. \n","So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you. \n   \n","And in keeping with what is written: “I believed, therefore I have spoken,” we who have the same spirit of faith also believe and therefore speak, \n","knowing that the One who raised the Lord Jesus  will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in His presence. \n","All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is extending to more and more people may overflow in thanksgiving, to the glory of God. \n   \n","Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, yet our inner self is being renewed day by day. \n","For our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an eternal glory that is far beyond comparison. \n","So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. \n"],["Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is dismantled, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands. \n","For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, \n","because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked. \n","So while we are in this tent, we groan under our burdens, because we do not wish to be unclothed but clothed, so that our mortality may be swallowed up by life. \n","And God has prepared us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a pledge of what is to come. \n   \n","Therefore we are always confident, although we know that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord. \n","For we walk by faith, not by sight. \n","We are confident, then, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord. \n","So we aspire to please Him, whether we are here in this body or away from it. \n","For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive his due for the things done in the body, whether good or bad. \n   \n","Therefore, since we know what it means to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is clear to God, and I hope it is clear to your conscience as well. \n","We are not commending ourselves to you again. Instead, we are giving you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you can answer those who take pride in appearances rather than in the heart. \n   \n","If we are out of our mind, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you. \n","For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that One died for all, therefore all died. \n","And He died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died for them and was raised again. \n   \n","So from now on we regard no one according to the flesh. Although we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. \n","Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away. Behold, the new has come! \n   \n","All this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: \n","that God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ, not counting men’s trespasses against them. And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation. \n   \n","Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ: Be reconciled to God. \n","God made Him who knew no sin to be sin  on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God. \n"],["As God’s fellow workers, then, we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. \n","For He says: \n  “In the time of favor I heard you, \n and in the day of salvation I helped you.” \n  Behold, now is the time of favor; now is the day of salvation! \n   \n","We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no one can discredit our ministry. \n   \n","Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships, and calamities; \n","in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in labor, sleepless nights, and hunger; \n","in purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; \n","in truthful speech and in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; \n","through glory and dishonor, slander and praise; viewed as imposters, yet genuine; \n","as unknown, yet well-known; dying, and yet we live on; punished, yet not killed; \n","sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything. \n   \n","We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians. Our hearts are open wide. \n","It is not our affection, but yours, that is restrained. \n","As a fair exchange, I ask you as my children: Open wide your hearts also. \n   \n","Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership can righteousness have with wickedness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? \n","What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? \n","What agreement can exist between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: \n  “I will dwell with them \n and walk among them, \n and I will be their God, \n and they will be My people.” \n   \n","“Therefore come out from among them \n and be separate, says the Lord. \n Touch no unclean thing, \n and I will receive you.” \n   \n","And: \n  “I will be a Father to you, \n and you will be My sons and daughters, \n says the Lord Almighty.” \n"],["Therefore, beloved, since we have these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that defiles body and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. \n   \n","Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one. \n","I do not say this to condemn you. I have said before that you so occupy our hearts that we live and die together with you. \n","Great is my confidence in you; great is my pride in you; I am filled with encouragement; in all our troubles my joy overflows. \n   \n","For when we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were pressed from every direction—conflicts on the outside, fears within. \n","But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the arrival of Titus, \n","and not only by his arrival, but also by the comfort he had received from you. He told us about your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced all the more. \n   \n","Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Although I did regret it, I now see that my letter caused you sorrow, but only for a short time. \n","And now I rejoice, not because you were made sorrowful, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you felt the sorrow that God had intended, and so were not harmed in any way by us. \n","Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation without regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. \n   \n","Consider what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what vindication! In every way you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter. \n","So even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did wrong or the one who was harmed, but rather that your earnestness on our behalf would be made clear to you in the sight of God. \n","On account of this, we are encouraged. \n  In addition to our own encouragement, we were even more delighted by the joy of Titus. For his spirit has been refreshed by all of you. \n","Indeed, I was not embarrassed by anything I had boasted to him about you. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus has proved to be true as well. \n","And his affection for you is even greater when he remembers that you were all obedient as you welcomed him with fear and trembling. \n","I rejoice that I can have complete confidence in you. \n"],["Now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the churches of Macedonia. \n","In the terrible ordeal they suffered, their abundant joy and deep poverty overflowed into rich generosity. \n","For I testify that they gave according to their ability and even beyond it. Of their own accord, \n","they earnestly pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints. \n","And not only did they do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, because it was the will of God. \n   \n","So we urged Titus to help complete your act of grace, just as he had started it. \n","But just as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness, and in the love we inspired in you  —see that you also excel in this grace of giving. \n","I am not making a demand, but I am testing the sincerity of your love in comparison to the earnestness of others. \n   \n","For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich. \n","And this is my opinion about what is helpful for you in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give, but even to have such a desire. \n","Now finish the work, so that you may complete it just as eagerly as you began, according to your means. \n","For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have. \n   \n","It is not our intention that others may be relieved while you are burdened, but that there may be equality. \n","At the present time, your surplus will meet their need, so that in turn their surplus will meet your need.

Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. \n","For I certify to you, brothers, that the gospel I preached was not devised by man. \n","I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. \n   \n","For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how severely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. \n","I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. \n   \n","But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased \n","to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not rush to consult with flesh and blood, \n","nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles who came before me, but I went into Arabia and later returned to Damascus. \n   \n","Only after three years did I go up to Jerusalem to confer with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days. \n","But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother. \n","I assure you before God that what I am writing to you is no lie. \n   \n","Later I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. \n","I was personally unknown, however, to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. \n","They only heard the account: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” \n","And they glorified God because of me. \n"],["Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem, accompanied by Barnabas. I took Titus along also. \n","I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I spoke privately to those recognized as leaders, for fear that I was running or had already run in vain. \n","Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. \n   \n","This issue arose because some false brothers had come in under false pretenses to spy on our freedom in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us. \n","We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you. \n   \n","But as for the highly esteemed—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism  —those leaders added nothing to me. \n","On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted to preach the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised. \n","For the One who was at work in Peter’s apostleship to the circumcised was also at work in my apostleship to the Gentiles. \n   \n","And recognizing the grace that I had been given, James, Cephas, and John—those reputed to be pillars—gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised. \n","They only asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do. \n   \n","When Cephas came to Antioch, however, I opposed him to his face, because he stood to be condemned. \n","For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself, for fear of those in the circumcision group. \n","The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray. \n   \n","When I saw that they were not walking in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “If you, who are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?” \n   \n","We who are Jews by birth and not Gentile “sinners” \n","know that a man is not justified by works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified. \n   \n","But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are found to be sinners, does that make Christ a minister of sin? Certainly not! \n","If I rebuild what I have already torn down, I prove myself to be a lawbreaker. \n   \n","For through the law I died to the law so that I might live to God. \n","I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me. \n","I do not set aside the grace of God.

Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. \n","I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith? \n   \n","Are you so foolish? After starting in the Spirit, are you now finishing in the flesh? \n","Have you suffered so much for nothing, if it really was for nothing? \n","Does God lavish His Spirit on you and work miracles among you because you practice the law, or because you hear and believe? \n   \n","So also, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” \n","Understand, then, that those who have faith are sons of Abraham. \n","The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and foretold the gospel to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.” \n","So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. \n   \n","All who rely on works of the law are under a curse. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.” \n","Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because, “The righteous will live by faith.” \n","The law, however, is not based on faith; on the contrary, “The man who does these things will live by them.” \n   \n","Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.” \n","He redeemed us in order that the blessing promised to Abraham  would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit. \n   \n","Brothers, let me put this in human terms. Even a human covenant, once it is ratified, cannot be canceled or amended. \n","The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say, “and to seeds,” meaning many, but “and to your seed,” meaning One, who is Christ. \n   \n","What I mean is this: The law that came 430 years later does not revoke the covenant previously established by God, so as to nullify the promise. \n","For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God freely granted it to Abraham through a promise. \n   \n","Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the arrival of the seed to whom the promise referred. It was administered through angels by a mediator. \n","A mediator is unnecessary, however, for only one party; but God is one. \n   \n","Is the law, then, opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come from the law. \n","But the Scripture pronounces all things confined by sin, so that by faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe. \n   \n","Before this faith came, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. \n","So the law became our guardian to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. \n","Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. \n   \n","You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. \n","For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. \n","There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. \n","And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the promise. \n"],["What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he is the owner of everything. \n","He is subject to guardians and trustees until the date set by his father. \n   \n","So also, when we were children, we were enslaved under the basic principles  of the world. \n","But when the time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, \n","to redeem those under the law, that we might receive our adoption as sons. \n","And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!” \n","So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, you are also an heir through God. \n   \n","Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. \n","But now that you know God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you are turning back to those weak and worthless principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again? \n","You are observing special days and months and seasons and years! \n","I fear for you, that my efforts for you may have been in vain. \n","I beg you, brothers, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong. \n   \n","You know that it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you. \n","And although my illness was a trial to you, you did not despise or reject me. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus Himself. \n","What then has become of your blessing? For I can testify that, if it were possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. \n","Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth? \n   \n","Those people are zealous for you, but not in a good way. Instead, they want to isolate you from us, so that you may be zealous for them. \n","Nevertheless, it is good to be zealous if it serves a noble purpose—at any time, and not only when I am with you. \n   \n","My children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, \n","how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you. \n   \n","Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not understand what the law says? \n","For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. \n","His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born through the promise. \n   \n","These things serve as illustrations, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children into slavery: This is Hagar. \n","Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present-day Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. \n","But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. \n","For it is written: \n  “Rejoice, O barren woman, \n who bears no children; \n break forth and cry aloud, \n you who have never travailed; \n because more are the children of the desolate woman \n than of her who has a husband.” \n   \n","Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. \n","At that time, however, the son born by the flesh persecuted the son born by the Spirit. It is the same now. \n   \n","But what does the Scripture say? “Expel the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.” \n","Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman. \n"],["It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not be encumbered once more by a yoke of slavery. \n   \n","Take notice: I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. \n","Again I testify to every man who gets himself circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. \n","You who are trying to be justified by the law have been severed from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. \n   \n","But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the hope of righteousness. \n","For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. All that matters is faith, expressed through love. \n   \n","You were running so well. Who has obstructed you from obeying the truth? \n","Such persuasion does not come from the One who calls you. \n","A little leaven works through the whole batch of dough. \n","I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is troubling you will bear the judgment, whoever he may be. \n   \n","Now, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. \n","As for those who are agitating you, I wish they would proceed to emasculate themselves! \n   \n","For you, brothers, were called to freedom; but do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. Rather, serve one another in love. \n","The entire law is fulfilled in a single decree: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” \n","But if you keep on biting and devouring one another, watch out, or you will be consumed by one another. \n   \n","So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. \n","For the flesh craves what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh.

So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers. \n","He says: \n  “I will proclaim Your name to My brothers; \n I will sing Your praises in the assembly.” \n   \n","And again: \n  “I will put My trust in Him.” \n  And once again: \n  “Here am I, and the children God has given Me.” \n   \n","Now since the children have flesh and blood, He too shared in their humanity, so that by His death He might destroy him who holds the power of death, that is, the devil, \n","and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. \n   \n","For surely it is not the angels He helps, but the descendants of Abraham. \n","For this reason He had to be made like His brothers in every way, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, in order to make atonement  for the sins of the people. \n","Because He Himself suffered when He was tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted. \n"],["Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, set your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess. \n","He was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house. \n   \n","For Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself. \n","And every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything. \n   \n","Now Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house, testifying to what would be spoken later. \n","But Christ is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are His house, if we hold firmly  to our confidence and the hope of which we boast. \n   \n","Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: \n  “Today, if you hear His voice, \n  \n","do not harden your hearts, \n as you did in the rebellion, \n in the day of testing in the wilderness, \n  \n","where your fathers tested and tried Me, \n and for forty years saw My works. \n  \n","Therefore I was angry with that generation, \n and I said, \n ‘Their hearts are always going astray, \n and they have not known My ways.’ \n  \n","So I swore on oath in My anger, \n ‘They shall never enter My rest.’” \n   \n","See to it, brothers, that none of you has a wicked heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God. \n","But exhort one another daily, as long as it is called today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness. \n   \n","We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance we had at first. \n","As it has been said: \n  “Today, if you hear His voice, \n do not harden your hearts, \n as you did in the rebellion.” \n   \n","For who were the ones who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? \n","And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? \n","And to whom did He swear that they would never enter His rest? Was it not to those who disobeyed? \n","So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were unable to enter. \n"],["Therefore, while the promise of entering His rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be deemed to have fallen short of it. \n","For we also received the good news just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, since they did not share the faith of those who comprehended it. \n   \n","Now we who have believed enter that rest. As for the others, it is just as God has said: \n  “So I swore on oath in My anger, \n ‘They shall never enter My rest.’” \n  And yet His works have been finished since the foundation of the world. \n","For somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this manner: “And on the seventh day God rested from all His works.” \n","And again, as He says in the passage above: “They shall never enter My rest.” \n   \n","Since, then, it remains for some to enter His rest, and since those who formerly heard the good news did not enter because of their disobedience, \n","God again designated a certain day as “Today,” when a long time later He spoke through David as was just stated: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.” \n   \n","For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. \n","There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God. \n","For whoever enters God’s rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from His. \n","Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same pattern of disobedience. \n   \n","For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart. \n","Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight; everything is uncovered and exposed before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account. \n   \n","Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we profess. \n","For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin. \n","Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. \n"],["Every high priest is appointed from among men to represent them in matters relating to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. \n","He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and misguided, since he himself is beset by weakness. \n","That is why he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. \n   \n","No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was. \n","So also Christ did not take upon Himself the glory of becoming a high priest, but He was called by the One who said to Him: \n  “You are My Son; \n today I have become Your Father.” \n   \n","And in another passage God says: \n  “You are a priest forever \n in the order of Melchizedek.” \n   \n","During the days of Jesus’ earthly life, He offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the One who could save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverence. \n","Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from what He suffered. \n","And having been made perfect, He became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey Him \n","and was designated by God as high priest in the order of Melchizedek. \n   \n","We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain, because you are dull of hearing. \n","Although by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to reteach you the basic principles of God’s word. You need milk, not solid food! \n   \n","For everyone who lives on milk is still an infant, inexperienced in the message of righteousness. \n","But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained their senses to distinguish good from evil. \n"],["Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith in God, \n","instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. \n","And this we will do, if God permits. \n   \n","It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, \n","who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age—\n","and then have fallen away—to be restored to repentance, because they themselves are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting Him to open shame. \n   \n","For land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is tended receives the blessing of God. \n","But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless, and its curse is imminent. In the end it will be burned. \n   \n","Even though we speak like this, beloved, we are convinced of better things in your case—things that accompany salvation. \n","For God is not unjust. He will not forget your work and the love you have shown for His name as you have ministered to the saints and continue to do so. \n   \n","We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure. \n","Then you will not be sluggish, but will imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised. \n   \n","When God made His promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself, \n","saying, “I will surely bless you and multiply your descendants.” \n","And so Abraham, after waiting patiently, obtained the promise. \n   \n","Men swear by someone greater than themselves, and their oath serves as a confirmation to end all argument. \n","So when God wanted to make the unchanging nature of His purpose very clear to the heirs of the promise, He guaranteed it with an oath. \n","Thus by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be strongly encouraged. \n   \n","We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, \n","where Jesus our forerunner has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. \n"],["This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, \n","and Abraham apportioned to him a tenth of everything. First, his name means “king of righteousness.” Then also, “king of Salem” means “king of peace.” \n","Without father or mother or genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God, he remains a priest for all time. \n   \n","Consider how great Melchizedek was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder. \n","Now the law commands the sons of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people—that is, from their brothers—though they too are descended from Abraham. \n","But Melchizedek, who did not trace his descent from Levi, collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. \n","And indisputably, the lesser is blessed by the greater. \n   \n","In the case of the Levites, mortal men collect the tenth; but in the case of Melchizedek, it is affirmed that he lives on. \n","And so to speak, Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham. \n","For when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the loin of his ancestor. \n   \n","Now if perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood (for on this basis the people received the law), why was there still need for another priest to appear—one in the order of Melchizedek and not in the order of Aaron? \n","For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed as well. \n   \n","He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar. \n","For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, a tribe as to which Moses said nothing about priests. \n   \n","And this point is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears, \n","one who has become a priest not by a law of succession, but by the power of an indestructible life. \n","For it is testified: \n  “You are a priest forever \n in the order of Melchizedek.” \n   \n","So the former commandment is set aside because it was weak and useless \n","(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God. \n   \n","And none of this happened without an oath. For others became priests without an oath, \n","but Jesus became a priest with an oath by the One who said to Him: \n  “The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind: \n ‘You are a priest forever.’” \n   \n","Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. \n   \n","Now there have been many other priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office. \n","But because Jesus lives forever, He has a permanent priesthood. \n","Therefore He is able to save completely  those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them. \n   \n","Such a high priest truly befits us—One who is holy, innocent, undefiled, set apart from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. \n","Unlike the other high priests, He does not need to offer daily sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people; He sacrificed for sin once for all when He offered up Himself. \n","For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever. \n"],["The point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, \n","and who ministers in the sanctuary and true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man. \n","And since every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, it was necessary for this One also to have something to offer. \n   \n","Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer gifts according to the law. \n","The place where they serve is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.” \n   \n","Now, however, Jesus has received a much more excellent ministry, just as the covenant He mediates is better and is founded on better promises. \n","For if that first covenant had been without fault, no place would have been sought for a second. \n","But God found fault with the people and said: \n  “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, \n when I will make a new covenant \n with the house of Israel \n and with the house of Judah. \n  \n","It will not be like the covenant \n I made with their fathers \n when I took them by the hand \n to lead them out of the land of Egypt, \n because they did not abide by My covenant, \n and I disregarded them, \n declares the Lord. \n  \n","For this is the covenant I will make \n with the house of Israel \n after those days, \n declares the Lord. \n I will put My laws in their minds \n and inscribe them on their hearts. \n And I will be their God, \n and they will be My people. \n  \n","No longer will each one teach his neighbor or his brother, \n saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ \n because they will all know Me, \n from the least of them to the greatest. \n  \n","For I will forgive their iniquities \n and will remember their sins no more.” \n   \n","By speaking of a new covenant, He has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear. \n"],["Now the first covenant  had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. \n","A tabernacle was prepared. In its first room were the lampstand, the table, and the consecrated bread. This was called the Holy Place. \n","Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, \n","containing the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. Inside the ark were the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. \n","Above the ark were the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy seat. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now. \n   \n","When everything had been prepared in this way, the priests entered regularly into the first room to perform their sacred duties. \n","But only the high priest entered the second room, and then only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. \n   \n","By this arrangement the Holy Spirit was showing that the way into the Most Holy Place  had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing. \n","It is an illustration for the present time, because the gifts and sacrifices being offered were unable to cleanse the conscience of the worshiper. \n","They consist only in food and drink and special washings—external regulations imposed until the time of reform. \n   \n","But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that have come, He went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made by hands and is not a part of this creation. \n","He did not enter by the blood of goats and calves, but He entered the Most Holy Place once for all by His own blood, thus securing eternal redemption. \n   \n","For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that their bodies are clean, \n","how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself unblemished to God, purify our  consciences from works of death, so that we may serve the living God! \n   \n","Therefore Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, now that He has died to redeem them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant. \n   \n","In the case of a will, it is necessary to establish the death of the one who made it, \n","because a will does not take effect until the one who made it has died; it cannot be executed while he is still alive. \n   \n","That is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood. \n","For when Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people, \n","saying, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.” \n   \n","In the same way, he sprinkled with blood the tabernacle and all the vessels used in worship. \n","According to the law, in fact, nearly everything must be purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. \n   \n","So it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. \n","For Christ did not enter a man-made copy of the true sanctuary, but He entered heaven itself, now to appear on our behalf in the presence of God. \n   \n","Nor did He enter heaven to offer Himself again and again, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. \n","Otherwise, Christ would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now He has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself. \n   \n","Just as man is appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment, \n","so also Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many; and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await Him. \n"],["For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the realities themselves. It can never, by the same sacrifices offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. \n","If it could, would not the offerings have ceased? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt the guilt of their sins. \n   \n","Instead, those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, \n","because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. \n","Therefore, when Christ came into the world, He said: \n  “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, \n but a body You prepared for Me. \n  \n","In burnt offerings and sin offerings \n You took no delight. \n  \n","Then I said, ‘Here I am, it is written about Me in the scroll: \n I have come to do Your will, O God.’” \n   \n","In the passage above He says, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not desire, nor did You delight in them” (although they are offered according to the law). \n","Then He adds, “Here I am, I have come to do Your will.” He takes away the first to establish the second. \n","And by that will, we have been sanctified through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. \n   \n","Day after day every priest stands to minister and to offer again and again the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. \n","But when this Priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God. \n","Since that time, He waits for His enemies to be made a footstool for His feet, \n","because by a single offering He has made perfect for all time those who are being sanctified. \n   \n","The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First He says: \n   \n","“This is the covenant I will make with them \n after those days, declares the Lord. \n I will put My laws in their hearts \n and inscribe them on their minds.” \n   \n","Then He adds: \n  “Their sins and lawless acts \n I will remember no more.” \n   \n","And where these have been forgiven, an offering for sin is no longer needed. \n   \n","Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place  by the blood of Jesus, \n","by the new and living way opened for us through the curtain of His body, \n","and since we have a great priest over the house of God, \n","let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. \n   \n","Let us hold resolutely to the hope we profess, for He who promised is faithful. \n","And let us consider how to spur one another on to love and good deeds. \n","Let us not neglect meeting together, as some have made a habit, but let us encourage one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching. \n   \n","If we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins remains, \n","but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume all adversaries. \n","Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. \n","How much more severely do you think one deserves to be punished who has trampled on the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and insulted the Spirit of grace? \n   \n","For we know Him who said, “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,”  and again, “The Lord will judge His people.” \n","It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. \n   \n","Remember the early days that you were in the light. In those days, you endured a great conflict in the face of suffering. \n","Sometimes you were publicly exposed to ridicule and persecution; at other times you were partners with those who were so treated. \n","You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, knowing that you yourselves had a better and permanent possession. \n   \n","So do not throw away your confidence; it holds a great reward. \n","You need to persevere, so that after you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised. \n","For, \n  “In just a little while, \n He who is coming will come and will not delay. \n  \n","But My righteous one will live by faith; \n and if he shrinks back, \n I will take no pleasure in him.” \n   \n","But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls. \n"],["Now faith is the assurance of what we hope for and the certainty of what we do not see. \n","This is why the ancients were commended. \n   \n","By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible. \n   \n","By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous when God gave approval to his gifts. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead. \n   \n","By faith Enoch was taken up   so that he did not see death: “He could not be found, because God had taken him away.” For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. \n   \n","And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who approaches Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him. \n   \n","By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in godly fear built an ark to save his family. By faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. \n   \n","By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, without knowing where he was going. \n","By faith he dwelt in the promised land as a stranger in a foreign country. He lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. \n","For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. \n   \n","By faith Sarah, even though she was barren and beyond the proper age, was enabled to conceive a child, because she considered Him faithful who had promised. \n","And so from one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore. \n   \n","All these people died in faith, without having received the things they were promised. However, they saw them and welcomed them from afar. And they acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. \n   \n","Now those who say such things show that they are seeking a country of their own. \n","If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. \n","Instead, they were longing for a better country, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them. \n   \n","By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac on the altar. He who had received the promises was ready to offer his one and only son, \n","even though God had said to him, “Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.” \n","Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and in a sense, he did receive Isaac back from death. \n   \n","By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the future. \n   \n","By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph’s sons and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. \n   \n","By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites and gave instructions about his bones. \n   \n","By faith Moses’ parents hid him for three months after his birth, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were unafraid of the king’s edict. \n   \n","By faith Moses, when he was grown, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. \n","He chose to suffer oppression with God’s people rather than to experience the fleeting enjoyment of sin. \n","He valued disgrace for Christ above the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his reward. \n   \n","By faith Moses left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because he saw Him who is invisible. \n","By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch Israel’s own firstborn. \n   \n","By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to follow, they were drowned. \n   \n","By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days. \n   \n","By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies in peace, did not perish with those who were disobedient. \n   \n","And what more shall I say? Time will not allow me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets, \n","who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, \n","quenched the raging fire, and escaped the edge of the sword; who gained strength from weakness, became mighty in battle, and put foreign armies to flight. \n   \n","Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused their release, so that they might gain a better resurrection. \n","Still others endured mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. \n   \n","They were stoned, they were sawed in two, they were put to death by the sword. They went around in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, oppressed, and mistreated. \n","The world was not worthy of them.

For if you practice these things you will never stumble, \n","and you will receive a lavish reception into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. \n   \n","Therefore I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are established in the truth you now have. \n","I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of my body, \n","because I know that this tent will soon be laid aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. \n","And I will make every effort to ensure that after my departure, you will be able to recall these things at all times. \n   \n","For we did not follow cleverly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty. \n","For He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to Him from the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” \n","And we ourselves heard this voice from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain. \n   \n","We also have the word of the prophets as confirmed beyond doubt. And you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. \n","Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation. \n","For no such prophecy was ever brought forth by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. \n"],["Now there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves. \n","Many will follow in their depravity, and because of them the way of truth will be defamed. \n","In their greed, these false teachers will exploit you with deceptive words. The longstanding verdict against them remains in force, and their destruction does not sleep. \n   \n","For if God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but cast them deep into hell, placing them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment; \n","if He did not spare the ancient world when He brought the flood on its ungodly people, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, among the eight; \n","if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction,  reducing them to ashes as an example of what is coming on the ungodly; \n","and if He rescued Lot, a righteous man distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless \n","(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)—\n","if all this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment. \n   \n","Such punishment is specially reserved for those who indulge the corrupt desires of the flesh and despise authority.

Blackest darkness is reserved for them. \n","With lofty but empty words, they appeal to the sensual passions of the flesh and entice those who are just escaping from others who live in error. \n","They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to depravity. For a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him. \n   \n","If indeed they have escaped the corruption of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, only to be entangled and overcome by it again, their final condition is worse than it was at first. \n","It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to have known it and then to turn away from the holy commandment passed on to them. \n","Of them the proverbs are true: “A dog returns to its vomit,” and, “A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud.” \n"],["Beloved, this is now my second letter to you.

The heavens will disappear with a roar, the elements will be destroyed   by fire, and the earth and its works will be laid bare. \n   \n","Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to conduct yourselves in holiness and godliness \n","as you anticipate and hasten the coming of the day of God, when the heavens will be destroyed by fire and the elements will melt in the heat. \n","But in keeping with God’s promise, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells. \n   \n","Therefore, beloved, as you anticipate these things, make every effort to be found at peace—spotless and blameless in His sight. \n   \n","Consider also that our Lord’s patience brings salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom God gave him. \n","He writes this way in all his letters,  speaking in them about such matters. Some parts of his letters are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction. \n   \n","Therefore, beloved, since you already know these things, be on your guard so that you will not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure standing. \n","But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

This is the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. \n   \n","Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear and obey what is written in it, because the time is near. \n   \n","John, \n  To the seven churches in the province of Asia: \n  Grace and peace to you from Him who is and was and is to come, and from the seven Spirits  before His throne, \n","and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. \n  To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood, \n","who has made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God and Father—to Him be the glory and power forever and ever! Amen. \n   \n","Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him—even those who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him. So shall it be! Amen. \n   \n","“I am the Alpha and the Omega, ” says the Lord God, who is and was and is to come—the Almighty. \n   \n","I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance that are in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and my testimony about Jesus. \n","On the Lord’s day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, \n","saying, “Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.” \n   \n","Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, \n","and among the lampstands was One like the Son of Man, dressed in a long robe, with a golden sash around His chest. \n","The hair of His head was white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes were like a blazing fire. \n","His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and His voice was like the roar of many waters. \n","He held in His right hand seven stars, and a sharp double-edged sword came from His mouth. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest. \n   \n","When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. But He placed His right hand on me and said, “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, \n","the Living One. I was dead, and behold, now I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of Death and of Hades. \n   \n","Therefore write down the things you have seen, and the things that are, and the things that will happen after this. \n","This is the mystery of the seven stars you saw in My right hand and of the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. \n"],["“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: \n  These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in His right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands. \n   \n","I know your deeds, your labor, and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate those who are evil, and you have tested and exposed as liars those who falsely claim to be apostles. \n","Without growing weary, you have persevered and endured many things for the sake of My name. \n   \n","But I have this against you: You have abandoned your first love. \n","Therefore, keep in mind how far you have fallen. Repent and perform the deeds you did at first. But if you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place. \n   \n","But you have this to your credit: You hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. \n   \n","He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who overcomes, I will grant the right to eat from the tree of life in the Paradise of God. \n   \n","To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: \n  These are the words of the First and the Last, who died and returned to life. \n   \n","I know your affliction and your poverty—though you are rich! And I am aware of the slander of those who falsely claim to be Jews, but are in fact a synagogue of Satan. \n   \n","Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Look, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison to test you, and you will suffer tribulation for ten days. Be faithful even unto death, and I will give you the crown of life. \n   \n","He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who overcomes will not be harmed by the second death. \n   \n","To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: \n  These are the words of the One who holds the sharp, double-edged sword. \n   \n","I know where you live, where the throne of Satan sits. Yet you have held fast to My name and have not denied your faith in Me, even in the day when My faithful witness Antipas was killed among you, where Satan dwells. \n   \n","But I have a few things against you, because some of you hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to place a stumbling block before the Israelites so they would eat food sacrificed to idols and commit sexual immorality. \n","In the same way, some of you also hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. \n","Therefore repent! Otherwise I will come to you shortly and wage war against them with the sword of My mouth. \n   \n","He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who overcomes, I will give the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone inscribed with a new name, known only to the one who receives it. \n   \n","To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: \n  These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like a blazing fire and whose feet are like polished bronze. \n   \n","I know your deeds—your love, your faith, your service, your perseverance—and your latter deeds are greater than your first. \n   \n","But I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads My servants to be sexually immoral and to eat food sacrificed to idols. \n","Even though I have given her time to repent of her immorality, she is unwilling. \n   \n","Behold, I will cast her onto a bed of sickness, and those who commit adultery with her will suffer great tribulation unless they repent of her deeds. \n","Then I will strike her children dead, and all the churches will know that I am the One who searches minds and hearts, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds. \n   \n","But I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned the so-called deep things of Satan: I will place no further burden upon you. \n","Nevertheless, hold fast to what you have until I come. \n","And to the one who overcomes and continues in My work until the end, I will give authority over the nations. \n","He will rule them with an iron scepter and shatter them like pottery  —just as I have received authority from My Father. \n","And I will give him the morning star. \n   \n","He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. \n"],["“To the angel of the church in Sardis write: \n  These are the words of the One who holds the seven Spirits  of God and the seven stars. \n  I know your deeds; you have a reputation for being alive, yet you are dead. \n","Wake up and strengthen what remains, which was about to die; for I have found your deeds incomplete in the sight of My God. \n","Remember, then, what you have received and heard. Keep it and repent. If you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know the hour when I will come upon you. \n   \n","But you do have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments, and because they are worthy, they will walk with Me in white. \n","Like them, he who overcomes will be dressed in white. And I will never blot out  his name from the Book of Life, but I will confess his name before My Father and His angels. \n   \n","He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. \n   \n","To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: \n  These are the words of the One who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What He opens no one can shut, and what He shuts no one can open. \n   \n","I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door, which no one can shut. For you have only a little strength, yet you have kept My word and have not denied My name. \n","Look at those who belong to the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews but are liars instead. I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and they will know that I love you. \n   \n","Because you have kept My command to persevere, I will also keep you from the hour of testing that is about to come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth. \n","I am coming soon. Hold fast to what you have, so that no one will take your crown. \n","The one who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will never again leave it. Upon him I will write the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God (the new Jerusalem that comes down out of heaven from My God), and My new name. \n   \n","He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. \n   \n","To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: \n  These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Originator  of God’s creation. \n   \n","I know your deeds; you are neither cold nor hot. How I wish you were one or the other! \n","So because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to vomit you out of My mouth! \n   \n","You say, ‘I am rich; I have grown wealthy and need nothing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked. \n","I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, white garments so that you may be clothed and your shameful nakedness not exposed, and salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see. \n","Those I love, I rebuke and discipline. Therefore be earnest and repent. \n   \n","Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him, and he with Me. \n","To the one who overcomes, I will grant the right to sit with Me on My throne, just as I overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne. \n   \n","He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.” \n"],["After this I looked and saw a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had previously heard speak to me like a trumpet was saying, “Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.” \n   \n","At once I was in the Spirit, and I saw a throne standing in heaven, with someone seated on it. \n","The One seated there looked like jasper and carnelian, and a rainbow that gleamed like an emerald encircled the throne. \n","Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these thrones sat twenty-four elders dressed in white, with golden crowns on their heads. \n   \n","From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder. Before the throne burned seven torches of fire. These are the seven Spirits  of God. \n","And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, as clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, covered with eyes in front and back. \n","The first living creature was like a lion, the second like a calf, the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like an eagle in flight. \n","And each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around and within. Day and night they never stop saying: \n  “Holy, Holy, Holy, \n is the Lord God Almighty, \n who was and is and is to come!” \n   \n","And whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the One seated on the throne who lives forever and ever, \n","the twenty-four elders fall down before the One seated on the throne, and they worship Him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying: \n   \n","“Worthy are You, our Lord and God, \n to receive glory and honor and power, \n for You created all things; \n by Your will they exist and came to be.” \n"],["Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the One seated on the throne. It had writing on both sides and was sealed with seven seals. \n","And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?” \n   \n","But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look inside it. \n","And I began to weep bitterly, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it. \n   \n","Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed to open the scroll and its seven seals.” \n   \n","Then I saw a Lamb who appeared to have been slain, standing in the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the seven Spirits  of God sent out into all the earth. \n","And He came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One seated on the throne. \n   \n","When He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp, and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. \n","And they sang a new song: \n  “Worthy are You to take the scroll and open its seals, \n because You were slain, \n and by Your blood You purchased for God \n those from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. \n  \n","You have made them to be a kingdom \n and priests to serve our God, \n and they will reign upon  the earth.” \n   \n","Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels and living creatures and elders encircling the throne, and their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands. \n","In a loud voice they were saying: \n  “Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, \n to receive power and riches \n and wisdom and strength \n and honor and glory and blessing!” \n   \n","And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying: \n  “To Him who sits on the throne \n and to the Lamb \n be praise and honor and glory and power \n forever and ever!” \n   \n","And the four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped. \n"],["Then I watched as the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say in a thunderous voice, “Come!” \n   \n","So I looked and saw a white horse, and its rider held a bow. And he was given a crown, and he rode out to overcome and conquer. \n   \n","And when the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!” \n   \n","Then another horse went forth. It was bright red, and its rider was granted permission to take away peace from the earth and to make men slay one another. And he was given a great sword. \n   \n","And when the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” \n  Then I looked and saw a black horse, and its rider held in his hand a pair of scales. \n","And I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures, saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not harm the oil and wine.” \n   \n","And when the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” \n   \n","Then I looked and saw a pale green horse. Its rider’s name was Death, and Hades followed close behind. And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill by sword, by famine, by plague, and by the beasts of the earth. \n   \n","And when the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony they had upheld. \n","And they cried out in a loud voice, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You avenge our blood and judge those who dwell upon the earth?” \n   \n","Then each of them was given a white robe and told to rest a little while longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers, were killed, just as they had been killed. \n   \n","And when I saw the Lamb open the sixth seal, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black like sackcloth of goat hair, and the whole moon turned blood red, \n","and the stars of the sky fell to the earth like unripe figs dropping from a tree shaken by a great wind. \n","The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place. \n   \n","Then the kings of the earth, the nobles, the commanders, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and free man hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains. \n","And they said to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us  from the face of the One seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. \n","For the great day of Their  wrath has come, and who is able to withstand it?” \n"],["After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back its four winds so that no wind would blow on land or sea or on any tree. \n","And I saw another angel ascending from the east, with the seal of the living God. And he called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea: \n","“Do not harm the land or sea or trees until we have sealed the foreheads of the servants of our God.” \n   \n","And I heard the number of those who were sealed, 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel: \n   \n","From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, \n from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, \n from the tribe of Gad 12,000, \n   \n","from the tribe of Asher 12,000, \n from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, \n from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000, \n   \n","from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, \n from the tribe of Levi 12,000, \n from the tribe of Issachar 12,000, \n   \n","from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, \n from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, \n and from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000. \n   \n","After this I looked and saw a multitude too large to count, from every nation and tribe and people and tongue, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands. \n","And they cried out in a loud voice: \n  “Salvation to our God, \n who sits on the throne, \n and to the Lamb!” \n   \n","And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. And they fell facedown before the throne and worshiped God, \n","saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God forever and ever! Amen.” \n   \n","Then one of the elders addressed me: “These in white robes,” he asked, “who are they, and where have they come from?” \n   \n","“Sir,” I answered, “you know.” \n  So he replied, “These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. \n","For this reason, \n  they are before the throne of God \n and serve Him day and night in His temple; \n and the One seated on the throne \n will spread His tabernacle over them. \n  \n","‘Never again will they hunger, \n and never will they thirst; \n nor will the sun beat down upon them, \n nor any scorching heat.’ \n  \n","For the Lamb in the center of the throne \n will be their shepherd. \n ‘He will lead them to springs of living water,’ \n and ‘God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’ ” \n"],["When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. \n","And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and they were given seven trumpets. \n   \n","Then another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, along with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar before the throne. \n","And the smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, rose up before God from the hand of the angel. \n   \n","Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it to the earth; and there were peals of thunder, and rumblings, and flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. \n   \n","And the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to sound them. \n   \n","Then the first angel sounded his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were hurled down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, along with a third of the trees and all the green grass. \n   \n","Then the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned to blood, \n","a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. \n   \n","Then the third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star burning like a torch fell from heaven and landed on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. \n","The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood oil, and many people died from the bitter waters. \n   \n","Then the fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun and moon and stars were struck. A third of the stars were darkened, a third of the day was without light, and a third of the night as well. \n   \n","And as I observed, I heard an eagle flying overhead, calling in a loud voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the remaining three angels!” \n"],["Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth, and it was given the key to the pit of the Abyss. \n","The star opened the pit of the Abyss, and smoke rose out of it like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit. \n   \n","And out of the smoke, locusts descended on the earth, and they were given power like that of the scorpions of the earth. \n","They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. \n","The locusts were not given power to kill them, but only to torment them for five months, and their torment was like the stinging of a scorpion. \n","In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will escape them. \n   \n","And the locusts looked like horses prepared for battle, with something like crowns of gold on their heads, and faces like the faces of men. \n","They had hair like that of women, and teeth like those of lions. \n","They also had thoraxes like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. \n","They had tails with stingers like scorpions, which had the power to injure people for five months. \n","They were ruled by a king, the angel of the Abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon,  and in Greek it is Apollyon. \n   \n","The first woe has passed. Behold, two woes are still to follow. \n   \n","Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God \n","saying to the sixth angel with the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” \n   \n","So the four angels who had been prepared for this hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind. \n","And the number of mounted troops was two hundred million; I heard their number. \n   \n","Now the horses and riders in my vision looked like this: The riders had breastplates the colors of fire, sapphire, and sulfur. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceeded fire, smoke, and sulfur. \n","A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke, and sulfur that proceeded from their mouths. \n","For the power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; indeed, their tails were like snakes, having heads with which to inflict harm. \n   \n","Now the rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the works of their hands. They did not stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk. \n","Furthermore, they did not repent of their murder, sorcery, sexual immorality, and theft. \n"],["Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head. His face was like the sun, and his legs were like pillars of fire. \n","He held in his hand a small scroll, which lay open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land. \n","Then he cried out in a loud voice like the roar of a lion. And when he cried out, the seven thunders sounded their voices. \n   \n","When the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to put it in writing. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.” \n   \n","Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven. \n","And he swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it: “There will be no more delay! \n","But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be fulfilled, just as He proclaimed to His servants the prophets.” \n   \n","Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go, take the small scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land.” \n   \n","And I went to the angel and said, “Give me the small scroll.” \n  “Take it and eat it,” he said. “It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.” \n   \n","So I took the small scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned bitter. \n   \n","And they told me, “You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.” \n"],["Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff and was told, “Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count the number of worshipers there. \n","But exclude the courtyard outside the temple. Do not measure it, because it has been given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for 42 months. \n","And I will empower my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” \n   \n","These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. \n","If anyone wants to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouths and devours their enemies. In this way, anyone who wants to harm them must be killed. \n","These witnesses have power to shut the sky so that no rain will fall during the days of their prophecy, and power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish. \n   \n","When the two witnesses have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will wage war with them, and will overpower and kill them. \n","Their bodies will lie in the street of the great city—figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—where their Lord was also crucified. \n","For three and a half days all peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will view their bodies and will not permit them to be laid in a tomb. \n","And those who dwell on the earth will gloat over them, and will celebrate and send one another gifts, because these two prophets had tormented them. \n   \n","But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered the two witnesses, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell upon those who saw them. \n","And the witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Come up here.” And they went up to heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched them. \n   \n","And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand were killed in the quake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. \n   \n","The second woe has passed. Behold, the third woe is coming shortly. \n   \n","Then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and loud voices called out in heaven: \n  “The kingdom of the world \n has become the kingdom of our Lord \n and of His Christ, \n and He will reign forever and ever.” \n   \n","And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God, \n","saying: \n  “We give thanks to You, O Lord God Almighty, \n the One who is and who was, \n because You have taken Your great power \n and have begun to reign. \n  \n","The nations were enraged, \n and Your wrath has come. \n The time has come to judge the dead  \n and to reward Your servants the prophets, \n as well as the saints and those who fear Your name, \n both small and great—\n and to destroy those who destroy the earth.” \n   \n","Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple. And there were flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder, and an earthquake, and a great hailstorm. \n"],["And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed in the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. \n","She was pregnant and crying out in the pain and agony of giving birth. \n   \n","Then another sign appeared in heaven: a huge red dragon with seven heads, ten horns, and seven royal crowns on his heads. \n","His tail swept a third of the stars from the sky, tossing them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, ready to devour her child as soon as she gave birth. \n   \n","And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was caught up to God and to His throne. \n","And the woman fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place for her to be nourished for 1,260 days. \n   \n","Then a war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. \n","But the dragon was not strong enough, and no longer was any place found in heaven for him and his angels. \n","And the great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him. \n   \n","And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying: \n  “Now have come the salvation and the power \n and the kingdom of our God, \n and the authority of His Christ. \n For the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down—\n he who accuses them day and night before our God. \n  \n","They have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb \n and by the word of their testimony. \n And they did not love their lives \n so as to shy away from death. \n  \n","Therefore rejoice, O heavens, \n and you who dwell in them! \n But woe to the earth and the sea; \n with great fury the devil has come down to you, \n knowing he has only a short time.” \n   \n","And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. \n","But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle to fly from the presence of the serpent to her place in the wilderness, where she was nourished for a time, and times, and half a time. \n   \n","Then from the mouth of the serpent spewed water like a river to overtake the woman and sweep her away in the torrent. \n","But the earth helped the woman and opened its mouth to swallow up the river that had poured from the dragon’s mouth. \n","And the dragon was enraged at the woman, and went to make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus. \n  And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea. \n"],["Then I saw a beast with ten horns and seven heads rising out of the sea. There were ten royal crowns on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads. \n","The beast I saw was like a leopard, with the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority. \n   \n","One of the heads of the beast appeared to be mortally wounded. But the mortal wound was healed, and the whole world marveled and followed the beast. \n","They worshiped the dragon who had given authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can wage war against it?” \n   \n","The beast was given a mouth to speak arrogant and blasphemous words, and authority to act for 42 months. \n","And the beast opened its mouth to speak blasphemies against God and to slander His name and His tabernacle—those who dwell in heaven. \n   \n","Then the beast was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them, and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation. \n","And all who dwell on the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life belonging to the Lamb who was slain. \n   \n","He who has an ear, let him hear: \n   \n","“If anyone is destined for captivity, \n into captivity he will go; \n if anyone is to die  by the sword, \n by the sword he must be killed.” \n  Here is a call for the perseverance and faith of the saints. \n   \n","Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. This beast had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon. \n","And this beast exercised all the authority of the first beast and caused the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose mortal wound had been healed. \n   \n","And the second beast performed great signs to cause even fire from heaven to come down to earth in the presence of the people. \n","Because of the signs it was given to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived those who dwell on the earth, telling them to make an image to the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet had lived. \n","The second beast was permitted to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship it to be killed. \n   \n","And the second beast required all people small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, \n","so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark—the name of the beast or the number of its name. \n   \n","Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and that number is 666. \n"],["Then I looked and saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him 144,000 who had His name and His Father’s name written on their foreheads. \n","And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of many waters and the loud rumbling of thunder.

I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright Morning Star.” \n   \n","The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” Let the one who hears say, “Come!” And let the one who is thirsty come, and the one who desires the water of life drink freely. \n   \n","I testify to everyone who hears the words of prophecy in this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. \n","And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and the holy city, which are described in this book. \n   \n","He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus! \n   \n","The grace of the Lord Jesus   be with all the saints. \n  Amen."]]}
