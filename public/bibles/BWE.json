Then they reached the town of Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a meeting place."]], [["As he had done in other places, Paul went into it. On three Sabbath days he explained what was written in the holy writings."]], [["He proved these things from the writings.

And some were leading women."]], [["But some Jews did not believe, and they were jealous. So they called some of the bad men together and made a crowd. They started to fight and to make plenty of trouble and noise in the city. At Jason’s house they went in by force to find Paul and Silas. They wanted to bring them outside to the people."]], [["But they did not find them. So they took Jason and some of the Christian brothers to the rulers of the city.

They say there is another king named Jesus.’"]], [["All the people and the rulers of the city became angry when they heard this."]], [["They made Jason and the other Christians pay much money.

His spirit was troubled about this."]], [["In the meeting place he talked with the Jews and those who believed in the true God. In the market every day, he talked to people he met there."]], [["There were some wise men who believed the teachings of Epicurius. They believed the teaching of other wise men called Stoics. Some of them began to talk with Paul. And some said, ‘What does this talker have to say?’ Others said, ‘He seems to be talking about new gods.’ This was because he was telling them about Jesus and how he was raised from death."]], [["So they took Paul and brought him to a meeting at the hill called Areopagus. They said, ‘We want to know what this new teaching is that you are talking about."]], [["You are telling us things we never heard before. We want to understand them.’"]], [["All the people of Athens and the strangers who lived there passed their time in one way.

But we tell it with a true heart just as God told it to us. We tell it as if we stood before God. And we tell it with Christ’s help."]]], [[["Do you think we are starting again to tell how good we are? Do we need letters to tell about us, as some teachers do? We do not need letters to you or from you to praise us."]], [["You yourselves are our letter. This letter has been written in our hearts. All people can read it and understand it."]], [["All can see that you are a letter from Christ written by us. It is not written in ink, but it is written in the Spirit of the living God. It is not written on pieces of rock, but on the hearts of people."]], [["We can say this because we trust in God. And we trust in God because of Christ."]], [["We are not good enough to think we can do anything ourselves. But God makes us able to do it."]], [["God has made a new start with people. He has given us a new way back to God. It is not a written law. The Spirit gives it to us. The written law brings death, but the Spirit gives life."]], [["The old law that brought death was written on pieces of rock. There was a very bright light when God gave it to the people. The people of Israel could not look at Moses because his face was so bright. And even as they saw it, the light on his face was going away."]], [["Now bringing the law was bright and wonderful. Will not bringing the Spirit be far more bright and wonderful?"]], [["Bringing the law was a wonderful thing even though it brought death. So bringing the good news that people can be put right with God is much more wonderful."]], [["The law was so bright and wonderful at first but has no light now. There is something else that is so much more bright and wonderful."]], [["The one which does not stay alive for ever came first in a great light. Does not the one which does stay alive have a much brighter light?"]], [["Because we believe this, we do not fear."]], [["We are not like Moses. He put a cloth over his face so that the people of Israel would not see that the light from God was dying."]], [["But their minds were made dull. Even today, when the old law of God is read, it is as if a cloth still covers it. It is Christ who takes the cloth away."]], [["Yes, even today, when the books of Moses are read, it is as if a cloth covers their hearts and minds."]], [["But when a man turns to the Lord, the cloth is taken away."]], [["Now the Lord is the Spirit. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, people are set free."]], [["All of us have no cloth over our faces. People can see that we have some of the bright and wonderful light that the Lord has. And we are becoming brighter and brighter, more and more like him. It is the Lord, the Spirit, who does this."]]], [[["God in his kindness gave us this work. So we do not give up."]], [["We never do wrong things nor do things in secret. We do not fool people nor change God’s message. No, we tell people the truth openly. We let every person judge us for himself. We know that God sees all we do."]], [["If the good news which we tell is not clear to some people, it is because they are lost. They do not believe."]], [["The god of this world has covered their minds so they cannot see. They cannot see with their minds the light of the good news of Christ. They cannot see how bright and wonderful Christ is. He is just like God himself."]], [["We do not talk about ourselves, but about Christ Jesus our Lord. And we are your slaves for Jesus’ sake."]], [["God said, ‘Let light shine in the darkness.’ And he has let light shine in our hearts too. He gave us light that shows how bright and wonderful God is. We see this light when we look at the face of Christ."]], [["This is something of great value within us, but we are like pots made of earth and clay. This power is greater than any other power. But it comes from God, not from us."]], [["We have much trouble, but we do not give up. We are in hard places, but help always comes."]], [["People trouble us, but God is always with us. We are beaten, but we are not killed."]], [["We always feel as if our body is dying, just as Jesus died. Then the life of Jesus also can be seen in our body."]], [["While we live we are always ready to die for Jesus. And so the life of Jesus is also seen in our bodies which will die."]], [["So then, while death is at work in us, life is at work at the same time."]], [["We believe the same way as the one who wrote, ‘I believed, and so I talked.’ We also believe, and so we talk to you."]], [["We know this. God raised up the Lord Jesus, and he will raise us up also with Jesus. He will bring us all to stand together before God."]], [["All this is happening for you so that the blessings of God will reach more people. Then more people will thank God. And this will make God’s name greater."]], [["So we do not give up. Our body gets weak, but our heart gets new strength day after day."]], [["The load of trouble we carry now is a little heavy. But this trouble is getting something great and wonderful ready for us which will last for ever."]], [["We are not looking at things that can be seen, but at things that cannot be seen. The things which can be seen last only a little while. But the things which cannot be seen last for ever."]]], [[["Our body is the house in which our spirit lives here on earth. When that house is destroyed, then God will give us another house. That house is not made by man’s hand. But God made it. It will last for ever in heaven."]], [["While we are in the house we have now, we are always crying and wanting to have our house from heaven."]], [["When we have moved into it, then we are sure that we will never be left without a house."]], [["While we are in this house, we cry and are troubled. It is not that we want to move out of this house, but we want to move into the other one. Then this body which will die will be changed into one which will live."]], [["God is the one who has made us ready for this change. He has already given us the Spirit. This is the first part of what we are to receive, and it proves that we will get more."]], [["So we always feel sure. While we live in our bodies we are not in our house with the Lord. We know that."]], [["We do not see these things, but we believe them."]], [["We feel sure that we will want to leave this body and go to live with the Lord."]], [["So it does not matter if we are living here or go to live there. Wherever we are we want to please the Lord."]], [["We must all stand before Christ to be judged. Then we will receive pay. If we have done well, our pay will be good. If we have not done well, our pay will not be good."]], [["We know that the Lord must be feared, so we try to get people to believe. God knows what we are and what we do. And we hope that in your hearts you, too, know."]], [["No, we are not praising ourselves again. But we are telling you this so that you may really be proud of us. Then you will be ready to answer people who are proud of themselves. They are proud of the things which can be seen. But in their hearts they have nothing to be proud of."]], [["If we are crazy, it is for God’s sake. If we are right in our minds, it is for your sakes."]], [["The love of Christ makes us do what we do to win men. We believe that one man died for all people."], ["it is as if we all died with him."]], [["He died for all, so that those who live would not live to please themselves. But they should live to please him who gave his life for them and rose again from death."]], [["So then we no longer know people by what we see on the outside. There was a time when we knew Christ that way, but now we do not know him that way any longer."]], [["So, if any man belongs to Christ, he is a new person. His old life has gone. You see, he has begun a new life."]], [["But it is God who has done all this. He sent Christ to make peace with us and to bring us back to himself. Now he has given us the work of bringing other people back to God."]], [["God was in Christ. He brought the world back to himself. He forgave them for the wrong things they had done. And he gave us the message that will bring people back to himself."]], [["So we are messengers for Christ. God is using us to call people. So we are standing here for Christ and begging people, ‘Come back to God!’"]], [["Christ did no wrong thing. But for our sake God put the blame for our wrong ways on Christ. So now God sees us as good, because we are in Christ."]]], [[["We work with God. So we beg you, do not take God’s blessing and get nothing from it."]], [["Because God has said. ‘I heard you call at the right time. And I helped you in the day when I saved you.’ See, now is the right time. Now is the day to be saved."]], [["We put nothing in anyone’s way. So no one can say our work is bad."]], [["In every way we try to show that we are good servants of God. We do not give up when there is much trouble, and things go wrong, and things are hard."]], [["We are being beaten and put in prison. We are being knocked around. We work hard. We are awake at night and we go hungry."]], [["We help you with our knowledge and by living a clean life, with the help of the Spirit. We are patient and kind. We help you by the Holy Spirit. We have shown true love."]], [["We have told you the truth with the power of God. These are the right things to use in our fight, and we have used them with both hands."]], [["Some people respect us and some do not. Some give us a good name and some a bad name. Some people say we fool people and yet we tell the truth."]], [["Many people do not know us, and yet many people know us very well. We almost die and yet we live. People give us much trouble but they do not kill us. We are very sad and yet always glad."]], [["We are poor, but we make many people rich. We have nothing, but really we have everything."]], [["We talk plainly to you people in Corinth. We love you with all our hearts."]], [["We have not stopped loving you, but you do not love us."]], [["I say this as to my own children. You should love us with all your hearts."]], [["Do not join your lives with those who do not believe. You and they are not equal. How can people who do right, work with those who do not obey God? How can light and darkness be in the same place?"]], [["How can Christ agree with Belial, the devil? How can a person who believes work with a person who does not believe?"]], [["Is there anything equal about a house of God and a house of idols? We are a house of the living God. God has said, ‘I will live in them and walk in them. I will be their God and they will be my people.’"]], [["So the Lord says, ‘Come away from among bad people. Stay away from them. Do not touch what is not clean. And I will receive you."]], [["I will be your father. And you shall be my sons and daughters.’ The Lord who is ruler of all says that."]]], [[["My dear people, since God has promised us these things, we should make ourselves clean. We should clean out everything that makes our lives or our spirits dirty. We should try to be altogether holy because we respect God with fear."]], [["Give us a place in your hearts. We have not done wrong to anyone. We have not hurt anyone. We have not taken anything from anyone."]], [["I do not say this to bring something against you. I have already told you that we love you very much. If we live or if we die, we will be together with you."]], [["I really trust you. I am very proud of you. I have received much comfort. Even in all of our troubles I am very glad."]], [["When we came to the country of Macedonia, we had no rest for our bodies. We had all kinds of trouble everywhere. There was fighting around us and our hearts were full of fear."]], [["But God comforts those who are in trouble, and when Titus came, we were comforted."]], [["You comforted him, and that comforted us. He told us that you wanted very much to see us. He told us that you were very sorry for what you had done. He told us that you want to stand with me. So now I am even more happy."]], [["I know that what I wrote in my letter made you sad. But I am not sorry I wrote it. Perhaps I was sorry at first, but now I am glad I sent it. I see the letter made you sad for a while. I do not like to make you sad, but I am glad that it made you sad and made you turn from your wrong ways. You took it all as from God. So then, we did not really hurt you."]], [["I know that what I wrote in my letter made you sad. But I am not sorry I wrote it. Perhaps I was sorry at first, but now I am glad I sent it. I see the letter made you sad for a while. I do not like to make you sad, but I am glad that it made you sad and made you turn from your wrong ways. You took it all as from God. So then, we did not really hurt you."]], [["When we are sad the way God wants us to be, we turn from our wrong ways. Then we are saved and we can never be sorry about that. But the sorrow of the world brings death."]], [["See what happened. When you were sad, the way God wanted you to be, then you tried to do the right thing. You wanted to free yourself from wrong. You hated what is wrong. You were afraid. You wanted very much to do what is right. You stood for the right. You punished wrong doing. In every way you showed that you did right in this matter."]], [["So, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the man who did wrong. And it was not for the sake of the man who had the wrong done to him. But I wrote so that you would see for yourselves, in the sight of God, how much we care for you."]], [["And so we have been comforted. Besides this, we were even more happy to see how happy Titus was. All of you really made his heart glad."]], [["I told him how proud I was of you. And really, I had nothing to be ashamed of. Everything we have said to you has been true. So also, what we told Titus about you proved true."]], [["He loves you even more when he remembers how you all obeyed him. You feared and trembled."]], [["I am glad that I can always trust you."]]], [[["My brothers, let me tell you how God has blessed the churches in Macedonia."]], [["They are being tested by much trouble. But they are always very happy. And they are very poor. Because of these two things, they give to others as if they were rich."]], [["I can tell you because I saw it myself. They gave as much as they could and even more than that. They did it all because they wanted to."]], [["They begged us to let them give something to help God’s people."]], [["And they did more than we thought they would do. First, they gave themselves to the Lord and to us, because we were doing God’s work."]], [["That is why we asked Titus to see about your gift. He started you off in your giving. And so he is the one to see that you finish it."]], [["We remember how well you do in everything. You do well in believing, in talking, in knowing things, in trying your best, and in the way you love us. So now, do well in giving this gift."]], [["I am not saying that you must do it. But I want to prove how strong your love is. That is why I have told you how other people show their love."]], [["You know how much love our Lord Jesus Christ had. He was rich, but he became poor for your sakes. Because he became poor, you can become rich."]], [["I tell you what I think. It is best for you to finish what you started a year ago. You were the first to think of helping, and you started to give money."]], [["So now, finish doing it. You wanted to do it, so now finish it. Give as much as you can."]], [["If a man wants to give, he is judged by what he has to give. He is not judged by what he cannot give."]], [["I do not want it to be easy for others and hard for you."]], [["I want it to be equal for everyone. Right now, you have plenty and are able to help them. Another time, when they have plenty, they will help you when you need it. In that way things will be equal."]], [["The holy writings say, ‘The person who had plenty did not have too much. And the person who did not have much, had enough.’"]], [["I thank God that he has put the same care for you into the heart of Titus that I have."]], [["He was glad to go when I asked him, but he is also coming to you because he himself wants to come."]], [["We are sending another brother with him. This brother has a good name in all the churches because he tells the good news."]], [["Not only that, but the churches have chosen him to travel with us as we take care of this gift. We are doing this so that the Lord will be praised. We want to help others."]], [["We do not want anyone to say that we have not done the right thing. So we are taking care of this big gift in the right way."]], [["We want to do what the Lord says is right, but also what people say is right."]], [["And we are also sending another brother with them. We have found him to be glad to help us in many matters, many times. And now he is much more glad to help because he trusts you very much."]], [["I want to say this. Titus is my close friend and he works with me. And about our other brothers, they have been sent by the churches. They bring praise to Christ."]], [["Now then, prove that you love them. Prove that what we have said about you is true. Then the churches will know it."]]], [[["Of course, I really do not need to write to you about the money to be given to God’s people."]], [["I know that you wanted to help. I am proud to tell the people of Macedonia about you. I tell them, ‘The people in Greece have been ready for a year.’ And what you did has made most of them want to do something too."]], [["But I am sending these brothers so that what we have said about you will be true in this way. I want you to be really ready with the gift, just as I said you would be."]], [["If some men from Macedonia come with me and see that you are not ready, then we will be ashamed, and you too. We will be ashamed that we were so sure."]], [["So I thought it would be good to send these brothers to you first. They will get this gift ready which you promised. Then it will be ready like a gift, and not as if you were forced to give it."]], [["Here is something to remember. ‘The man who plants a little bit will get only a little from it. The man who plants much will get much from it.’"]], [["Everyone should give what he wants in his heart to give. He should be glad to give it, and should not give it because he was forced to give. ‘God loves a person who gives gladly.’"]], [["God is able to give you even more blessings than you need. In all things you will always have all you need for yourselves, and you will have enough to help all others."]], [["The holy writings say, ‘A good man gives away many things. He gives to the poor people. He will always be a good man in the sight of God.’"]], [["God is the one who gives seed to plant and bread to eat. He will give you enough to give away and will make it become more and more. Of the good things you do he will give you a big harvest."]], [["You will become rich in every way. And then you will have enough to give plenty to all people. And many people will thank God for your gifts which we will bring them."]], [["This gift of money will help to give God’s people what they need. It will also make many people thank God."]], [["This gift will prove something to them. They will praise God because you obey the good news of Christ. They will praise God because you have given this gift to help them and all the others."]], [["They will love you and talk to God about you, because God has blessed you very much."]], [["Thank God for his gift so great that no words can ever tell it all!"]]], [[["Now I, Paul, beg you to do something since you know that Christ was kind and gentle. You say I am weak when I am face to face with you, but when I am not with you, then I speak to you with hard words."]], [["I beg you, do not force me to talk hard words when I come. I have made up my mind to talk hard words against some people. They think we are living for the things in this world."]], [["Of course we are living in bodies made for this world. But we are not fighting for the things in this world."]], [["We do not use the things of this world in our fighting, but we use the power of God. This power can break down the walls where the enemy hides."]], [["We can break down what people think and every big idea that tries to stop people from knowing God. And we can make every thought a prisoner to obey Christ."]], [["Only when you all obey, then we are ready to punish anyone who will not obey."]], [["Surely you can see this. If one person is sure that he belongs to Christ, then he should see that we too belong to Christ just as he does."]], [["The Lord gave us power to build you up, not to break you down. Maybe I talk about it too much. But I feel I am right in talking about it."]], [["I do not want you to think that I am trying to make you afraid by my letters."]], [["Some people say, ‘Paul’s letters make us listen. They are strong. But he himself is weak and what he says is not worth listening to.’"]], [["People like that should know this. When we come we will do what we have said in our letters."]], [["We do not want to be like those people who praise themselves.

No, we will only be proud of those things which God has given us to do. And he has sent us even as far as you."]], [["We are not going farther than we should when we come to you.

We hope that you will believe more strongly, so that we can do more work among you, as God gives it to us."]], [["Then we hope to tell the good news in places far beyond you. We will not be proud of the work given to someone else to do–work that was done before we got there."]], [["The holy writings say that the person who is proud should be proud only of the Lord."]], [["A man who praises himself is not a man who is good. The man who is really good is the man whom the Lord praises."]]], [[["I want to say something a little bit foolish. But please listen to me!"]], [["I love you as God loves you.

He took the writing away and nailed it to a cross."]], [["He won the victory over powers and rulers. He showed that they had no power at all.

There Christ is sitting at the right hand of God."]], [["Think about the things that are in heaven, not about things that are on earth."]], [["Your old life died with Christ and your new life is kept with Christ in God."]], [["Christ is our life. When he comes again and is seen, then you will also be seen with him. And you will be great."]], [["So then, put to death those things of this world which are in you. I mean these things: wrong sex, things that are not clean, a heart that is burning to do wrong things, wanting what is wrong, and wanting to have what other people have. This last one is like worshipping an idol."]], [["They are things that make God angry."]], [["You used to do these things when you lived that way."]], [["But now you must stop all these: being angry, hating people, wrong feelings toward others, saying wrong things about people, and dirty talking."]], [["Do not tell lies to one another. You have stopped being the person you used to be who did wrong things."]], [["And now you have become a new person. That new person is always learning more and more until he becomes like God who made him."]], [["In this new person, there is no difference between a Greek and a Jew. There is no difference between a man who is circumcised with the mark of the Jew and a man who is not circumcised.

Control your strong feelings. Do not act like the people who do not know God."]], [["Do not do wrong to your Christian brother by taking his wife for yourself. The Lord will surely punish all those who do wrong in these things. We have already told you that and made it very clear."]], [["God did not call us to live unclean lives.

No, we must keep watching and not get drunk."]], [], [["Because we belong to the day, we must not get drunk. But we must be ready like people dressed for war. We must keep believing in God.

I heard the voice of one of the four living beings call, ‘Come!’ It sounded like thunder."]], [["And I looked and saw a white horse. The man who rode on it had a bow to shoot arrows. A gold crown for his head was given to him. And he went out fighting to win the victory over his enemies."]], [["When the Lamb opened the second lock, I heard the second living being call, ‘Come!’"]], [["And another horse came out. It was red. The man who rode on it was allowed to take peace away from the earth, so that men would kill each other. The man who rode on it was given a long knife or sword."]], [["When the Lamb opened the third lock, I heard the third living being call, ‘Come!’ I looked and saw a black horse. The man who rode on it had scales in his hand to weigh things."]], [["I heard a voice among the four living beings. It said, ‘Four cups of wheat for bread will sell for a day’s wages. Twelve cups of barley will sell for a day’s wages. But do not destroy the oil and the wine.’"]], [["When the Lamb opened the fourth lock, I heard the fourth living being call, ‘Come!’"]], [["I saw a horse the colour of ashes. The name of the man who rode it was Death. And the one who controls the world of the dead followed him. They were given power over a fourth part of the world. They could kill people with a sword, or by making them go without food to eat, or by making them sick, or with wild animals."]], [["When the Lamb opened the fifth lock, I saw the souls of people who had been killed. They were under the holy table where incense is burned. They had been killed because they believed God’s word and said they believed it."]], [["They called in a loud voice, ‘Lord, you are holy and true. How long will you wait before you judge and punish the people on earth because they killed us?’"]], [["Then each one of them was given a white gown to wear. They were told to wait a little longer for the other Christian brothers. Those who worked with them for the Lord would be killed as they had been."]], [["I saw the Lamb opening the sixth lock. The earth shook very much. The sun became very dark, like the black cloth people wear to show they are sad. The full moon became red like blood."]], [["The stars in the sky fell to the earth. They fell like figs that are not ripe when the fig tree is shaken by a strong wind."]], [["The sky was taken away like paper being rolled up. Every big hill and island was shaken out of its place."]], [["The kings of the world, the great men, the army captains, the rich people, the strong people, every slave, and every freeman hid themselves in holes and the rocks on the big hills."]], [["They called to the hills and to the rocks and said, ‘Fall on us! Hide us so the One on the throne will not see us. Hide us from the Lamb who is angry with us."]], [["The great day has come, and he is very angry with us. Who can stand before him?’"]]], [[["After this, I saw four angels standing at four different places on the earth. They were holding back the winds coming from every way. They did this so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree."]], [["Then I saw another angel coming up from the place where the sun rises. He had something to put the mark of the living God on people. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels. They had been given power to hurt the earth and the sea."]], [["The angel said, ‘Do not hurt the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have put a mark on the foreheads of God’s servants.’"]], [["And I heard that one hundred and forty-four thousand people were marked. They were from every tribe of Israel."]], [["Twelve thousand people were marked from each of these tribes: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin."]], [["Twelve thousand people were marked from each of these tribes: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin."]], [["Twelve thousand people were marked from each of these tribes: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin."]], [["Twelve thousand people were marked from each of these tribes: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin."]], [["After this, I looked and saw many people. There were so many that no person could count them all. They were from every country, tribe, nation, and language. I saw them standing in front of the throne and the Lamb. They wore white clothes and they had palm branches in their hands."]], [["They called in a loud voice and said, ‘Our God who sits on the throne, and the Lamb: they are the Ones who save people. Salvation belongs to them!’"]], [["All the angels were standing around the throne and around the leaders and the four living beings. They bowed down their faces in front of the throne and worshipped God."]], [["They said, ‘May it be so! Blessing, praise, glory and wisdom, thanks, honour, power, and strength belong to our God for ever and ever! Amen!’"]], [["Then one of the leaders talked to me. He said, ‘Who are these people wearing white clothes? Where did they come from?’"]], [["Then I said to him, ‘Sir, I do not know.’ And he said to me, ‘These are the people who have had much trouble. They have washed their clothes in the blood of the Lamb and made them white."]], [["That is why they are in front of God’s throne. They worship him day and night in his temple.

The sun or any other heat will not burn them."]], [["The Lamb who is in front of the throne will take care of them. He will guide them to the places where there is water that gives life. And God will wipe every tear from their eyes.’"]]], [[["When the Lamb opened the seventh lock, all was quiet in heaven for about a half hour."]], [["Then I saw the seven angels stand in front of God. Seven horns or trumpets were given to them."]], [["Another angel came and stood at the altar. He had a gold bowl. Plenty of incense was given to him. He was to put it with all the words of all God’s people when they talk to him. He was to put it on the gold altar in front of God’s throne."]], [["The sweet smelling smoke of the burning incense went up at the same time as the prayer words of God’s people. They went up from the hand of the angel that was standing in front of God."]], [["Then the angel took the bowl and filled it with fire from the altar. He threw it on the earth. There was thunder, loud noises, and lightning. And the earth shook."]], [["The seven angels who had the seven horns or trumpets got ready to blow them."]], [["The first angel blew his trumpet. Rain like stones, and fire mixed with blood, fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burned. A third of the trees was burned. And one third of all the green grass was burned."]], [["The second angel blew his trumpet. Then something like a big hill, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea."]], [["Then a third of the sea became blood. A third of all things that lived in the sea died. A third of all the boats was broken."]], [["The third angel blew his trumpet. A big star fell from the sky. It burned and gave a bright light. It fell on a third of the rivers and places where there is water."]], [["The name of the star is Bitter. A third part of the water became bitter. Many men died because the water was made bad to drink."]], [["The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun was made dark. And a third of the moon and a third of the stars were made dark. A third part of them became dark. A third part of the day had no light, and also a third part of the night."]], [["Then I looked and heard an angel who was flying across the sky. He called in a loud voice and said, ‘Trouble! Trouble! Trouble to the people who live on earth! Big trouble will come when the sound of the other trumpets is heard. The three angels are now ready to blow their trumpets!’"]]], [[["Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet. I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The key to the big hole that has no bottom was given to the angel."]], [["He opened the big hole and smoke came out. It was like the smoke of a very big fire. The sun and the air were made dark by the smoke from the big hole."]], [["Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth like big grasshoppers. They were given the power to hurt people the way that scorpions do."]], [["They were told not to spoil any of the grass, nor any green plant, nor any tree on earth. They were told to hurt only the people who did not have God’s mark on their foreheads."]], [["They were told not to kill them, but to trouble them for five months. The pain they give is like the pain a scorpion gives when it strikes a person."]], [["In those days people will look for death, but they will not be able to find it. They will want to die, but death will fly away from them."]], [["The locusts looked like horses ready to go to war. On their heads were gold crowns. And they had faces like people."]], [["Their hair was like women’s hair and their teeth like lions’ teeth."]], [["Their bodies were covered by something like pieces of iron. The noise of their wings sounded like many wagons and horses running to war."]], [["The locusts had tails like scorpions that could strike people and hurt them for five months."]], [["The king of the locusts is the angel of the big hole that has no bottom. His name is Abaddon in the Jew’s language and Apollyon in the Greek language. (This means, the one who destroys.)"]], [["The first trouble is gone. Two more troubles are coming after it."]], [["The sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar in front of God."]], [["The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, ‘Untie the four angels who are tied at the big river Euphrates.’"]], [["So the four angels were let free. They were ready for the hour, the day, the month, and the year when they would kill a third of the people."]], [["In their army were many, many thousands of men on horses. I heard the number of them."]], [["I saw what the horses and the men that sat on them looked like. The bodies of the men were covered by pieces of iron that looked red like fire and blue, and yellow. The heads of the horses were like lions’ heads. Fire, smoke and dust came out of their mouths. The dust was sulphur which choked and killed people when it burned in the fire."]], [["By these three big troubles a third part of the people were killed. They were killed by the fire, smoke, and choking sulphur dust that came out of the mouths of the horses."]], [["The power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. Their tails have heads and are like snakes. They hurt people with them."]], [["The other people were not killed by these big troubles. But they did not stop worshipping what they had made with their hands. They did not stop worshipping bad spirits and idols made of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood. These idols cannot see or hear or walk."]], [["And they did not stop their killing, or their witchcraft, or their wrong ways of using sex, or their stealing."]]], [[["Then I saw another strong angel coming down from the sky. A cloud was around him and a rainbow was over his head. His face was like the sun and his legs were like posts of fire."]], [["In his hand he had a small book that was open. He put his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land."]], [["He called in a very loud voice like a lion roaring. When he called, it was like the voices of seven thunders."]], [["When the seven thunders had spoken, I was going to write down what they said. But I heard a voice from the sky that said, ‘Do not tell what the seven thunders said. Do not write it down.’"]], [["The angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward the sky."]], [["He made a promise in the name of the one who lives for ever and ever.

He said, ‘There is no more time."]], [["But when the seventh angel calls by blowing his trumpet, then the secret plan of God will be finished. It will happen just as God told his servants, the prophets.’"]], [["The voice I heard in the sky talked to me again. It said, ‘Go to the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land. Take the open book from his hand.’"]], [["So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. He said to me, ‘Take it and eat it. It will be bitter inside you, but it will be sweet like honey in your mouth.’"]], [["So I took the little book from the angel’s hand and ate it. It was sweet like honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter."]], [["Then he said to me, ‘You must tell again what God is saying to many nations, countries, languages, and kings.’"]]], [[["Then I was given a long stick. And he said, ‘Go and measure God’s temple and the altar, and count the people who worship there."]], [["Do not measure the part outside the temple. Leave it out, because it has been given to the people who do not believe in God. They will walk in the holy city for forty-two months."]], [["I will give power to the two men who speak for me. They will speak words from God. They will continue to speak for forty-two months. They will wear clothes like people wear to show they are sad.’"]], [["These two men are the two olive trees and the two lamps which stand in front of the Lord of the earth."]], [["If any one wants to hurt them, fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies. If anyone wants to hurt them, he must be killed in this way."]], [["These two men can stop the sky from raining all the days that they speak words from God. And they can turn the water into blood. They can bring all kinds of trouble to the earth as often as they want."]], [["There is a beast which is a wild animal in the big hole that has no bottom. When the two men have finished talking, the beast will come up out of the hole. It will fight with the men. It will win over them and kill them."]], [["Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the big city. This city is called, ‘Sodom’ and ‘Egypt,’ because it is like them. Also it is where our Lord was nailed to a cross."]], [["People from many nations, tribes, languages, and countries will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days. They will not let anyone bury them."]], [["The people on earth will be very glad to see them dead. They will have a happy time. They will give gifts to each other because these two men from God had troubled the people on the earth."]], [["But after the three and a half days, life came into them. They stood on their feet. And all those who saw them were very much afraid."]], [["Then they heard a loud voice from the sky saying to them, ‘Come up here!’ They went up into the sky in a cloud. And the men who hated them saw them go up."]], [["At that time, the earth shook very much. A tenth part of the city fell down. Seven thousand people were killed by the shaking of the earth. The other people were very much afraid and they give glory to God in heaven."]], [["The second trouble is gone. The third trouble is coming soon."]], [["Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet. Loud voices were heard in the sky. They said, ‘The kingdom of the world now belongs to our Lord and to his Christ. He will rule for ever and ever.’"]], [["Then the twenty-four leaders who sat on their thrones in front of God kneeled down and worshipped God."]], [["They said, ‘We thank you, Lord God, who has all power. You live now and you always have lived. We thank you because you have now used your power and started to rule."]], [["‘The people who did not believe you became angry. But now you are angry.

It is time to destroy those who destroy the earth.’"]], [["Then the temple of God in heaven was opened. The box where his agreement was kept was seen inside the temple. And there was lightning, loud noises, and thunder. The earth shook and much rain, like stones, fell."]]], [[["I saw a wonderful thing in the sky. A woman was wearing the sun like a dress. She stood on the moon. On her head she had twelve stars in a big ring like a crown. She was going to have a baby."]], [["She cried out in pain because it was time for the baby to be born."]], [["And another wonderful thing was seen in the sky. It was a big red dragon. He had seven heads and ten horns. He had seven big rings on his heads."]], [["His tail struck a third part of the stars from the sky to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who would soon have a baby. He wanted to eat her baby when it was born."]], [["Then her baby boy was born. He will rule all the countries with an iron stick. Her child was taken up to God, to God’s throne."]], [["The woman ran away into the wilderness. There God had made a place ready for her. There she will have food for forty-two months."]], [["Then there was fighting in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back."]], [["But they did not win the fight and no longer were they allowed to stay in heaven."]], [["The dragon was thrown down. He was that old snake who is called the devil and Satan. He fools all the people in the world.

The devil has come down to you. He is very angry. He knows that he has only a short time!’"]], [["And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to earth, he troubled the woman to whom a baby boy had been born."]], [["But the woman was given two wings like a big eagle’s wings. With them she could fly away from the dragon into the wilderness to her place where she would have food for three and a half periods of time."]], [["The dragon poured water like a river out of his mouth after her. He wanted the water to carry her away."]], [["But the earth helped the woman. It opened a big hole. And the river which the dragon had poured out of his mouth went down the hole."]], [["Then the dragon was very angry with the woman. He went away to fight against the other children of the woman. They are the ones who keep the laws of God and tell the truth about Jesus."]]], [[["Then I stood on the sand by the sea. I saw a wild animal come up out of the sea. The beast had seven heads and ten horns. On its horns were ten big crowns. On its heads it had names that did not respect God."]], [["The beast I saw was like a leopard. It had feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion. The dragon gave it his own strength, his own throne, and great power."]], [["One of its heads had a cut, bad enough to kill it.

It was given power to rule over every tribe, nation, language, and country."]], [["Everyone on earth will worship the beast, if they do not have their names in the book of life. The book of life belongs to the Lamb who was killed. That was God’s plan since the world was made."]], [["He who can hear should listen:"]], [["Anyone who puts people in prison will go to prison. Any one who kills others with a long knife or sword will be killed by a long knife or sword.

It had two horns like a lamb but talked like a dragon."]], [["It uses all the power of the first beast and stands with it. It makes all the earth and those who live on it worship the first beast. That was the beast whose bad cut was healed."]], [["The second beast does wonderful things. It even makes fire fall from the sky to the earth for everyone to see."]], [["It fools the people who live on earth by the wonderful things which it has been given power to do, while the first beast looks on.

The idol of the beast could speak and command all those who would not worship the idol to be killed."]], [["It makes all the people take a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads. That means all people, those who are great and those who are not great, the poor, free men, and slaves."]], [["No one could buy or sell anything if he did not have this mark. This mark is the name of the beast or the number of its name."]], [["Here wisdom is needed. If a person understands, he should count the number of the beast. It is the number of a man’s name.

When I saw her, I was very much surprised."]], [["The angel asked me, ‘Why are you surprised? I will tell you the secret meaning of the woman and the beast with seven heads and horns that carries her."]], [["‘The beast that you saw was alive at one time, then it was dead. It will come up from the big hole that has no bottom and it will be killed. The people on earth will be surprised when they see the beast, because it was alive and then it was dead, and it comes alive again. These are the people who do not have their names written in the book of life from the time the world was made."]], [["‘To understand this, one must be wise. The seven heads are the seven hills on which the woman is sitting."]], [["They are also seven kings. Five have already lost their power. One is ruling now, and the other one has not yet come. When he comes he will rule for a short time."]], [["The beast that was alive at the one time, and then was dead, is the eighth king. He is really one of the seven. He will be killed."]], [["The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet ruled. They will have power for one hour to rule with the animal."]], [["These ten all think the same way, and they give to the beast their power and right to rule."]], [["They will fight against the Lamb, but the Lamb will win the fight against them. He will win because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. ‘Those who are with the Lamb will also win. God has called them and chosen them, and they believe in him.’"]], [["And the angel said to me, ‘You saw the water on which the bad woman is sitting. The water is the many nations, many people, many countries, and many languages."]], [["You saw the ten horns and the animal. They will hate the bad woman. They will take away everything she has and her fine clothes. They will eat her body and burn her up in a fire."]], [["God has put it into their hearts to do what he wants done to her. They will all agree. They will give to the beast their power to rule until what God has said comes true."]], [["‘The woman whom you saw is the big city that rules over the kings on earth.’"]]], [[["After that I saw another angel coming down from the sky. He had much power. The bright light that shone from him lit up the earth."]], [["He called in a loud voice and said, ‘The big city of Babylon has fallen down! It has fallen down! Bad spirits live in it. All bad spirits hide there. And all kinds of dirty birds that people hate hide there."]], [["All the nations are broken down because they are full of its wrong ways. The kings of the earth have joined with it. The traders of the earth have become rich because of its wrong ways.’"]], [["Then I heard another voice from the sky that said, ‘Come out of it, my people, so that you will have no part in the wrong things it does. Come out of it so that you will not have the big troubles it will have."]], [["Its wrong ways are piled as high as the sky and God has remembered the wrong things it has done."]], [["Do to it what it did to you. Yes, do two times as much to it as it did to you! From the cup it gave you to drink, give it two times as much to drink as it gave to you."]], [["It is proud of itself and has done wrong things. Give it that much trouble and crying. It says in its heart, “I am like a queen. I am not like a woman who has lost her husband. I will never know sorrow.”"]], [["So then, its big troubles will come in one day. Those troubles are death, crying, hunger, and being burned in a fire. The Lord who has punished it is strong.’"]], [["‘And the kings of the earth were joined with it in its wrong ways. They will cry and be sad about it when they see the smoke while it burns."]], [["They will stand far away from it because they are afraid of the trouble it is having. They will say, “Trouble! Trouble! You big, strong city Babylon! In one hour your punishment has come!”"]], [["‘And the traders of the earth will cry and be sad about it, because no one buys the things they bring to sell."]], [["They have many things to sell: gold, silver, fine stones, and pearls. They have linen clothes and blue cloth, silk cloth and red cloth. They have all kinds of sweet smelling wood. They have all kinds of things made of ivory. They have all kinds of things made of wood that costs much money, of brass, of iron, and of a stone called marble."]], [["They have spices and perfume. They have incense and a sweet-smelling oil. They have frankincense and wine and oil. They have fine flour and wheat. They have cows, sheep, horses, and wagons. They have slaves and people to sell."]], [["The things that your heart wanted are gone from you. All your fine food and clothes are gone from you. You will never find them again."]], [["The traders will sell these things and got much money from the city. They will stand far away from it because they are afraid of the trouble it is having. They will cry and be sad about it."]], [["They will say “How terrible for you, you big strong city! You were wearing linen clothes and purple and red clothes. You were shining with gold, fine stones, and pearls."]], [["In one hour all your great riches are lost.” ‘And all the captains of the boats and all the seamen, the sailors, and all that do business on the sea stood away from it."]], [["They called out loud when they saw the smoke while it burned. They said, “What city is like that big city?”"]], [["They threw dust on their heads and they called out loud. They cried and were sad. They said, “How terrible for that big city! All the men who had boats on the sea became rich because it was rich. In one hour it is all lost.”"]], [["‘Be glad for what has happened to it, all you who are in heaven, God’s people, apostles and prophets. God has punished it for what it did to you!’"]], [["Then a strong angel took up a very heavy stone and threw it into the sea. He said, ‘So hard will Babylon the big city be thrown down. It will not be seen again."]], [["People will not hear music in you again. No harps, no singing, no pipes or horns will ever be heard in you again. No one will make things in you again. The noise of people grinding grain will not be heard in you again."]], [["No lamp will shine in you again. No one will hear the voice of people being married. Your traders were the big people of the world. All the countries were fooled by your witch doctors."]], [["The blood of prophets and of God’s people and of all who have been killed on earth was found in that city.’"]]], [[["After this I heard a loud sound in heaven. It sounded like many people calling. They said, ‘Praise our God! He saves people. He is great and power belongs to him."]], [["The way God punishes is true and right. He has punished the bad woman who spoiled the earth with her wrong ways. He has made her pay for the killing of his servants.’"]], [["They said again, ‘Praise God! The smoke where she burns goes up for ever and ever!’"]], [["Then the twenty-four leaders and the four living beings kneeled down. They worshipped God who was sitting on his throne, and they said, ‘Amen! Yes, it is so! Praise God!’"]], [["A voice from the throne said, ‘Praise our God, all his servants, all who respect and honour him: you who are great and you who are not great, praise him!’"]], [["Then I heard a sound in heaven. It sounded like many people and much water flowing and like loud thunder. They said, ‘Praise God! The Lord our God, who has all power, rules!"]], [["We will be glad and very happy! We will praise him. The time has come for the Lamb to marry. The woman who will marry him is ready."]], [["She was given the right to wear fine linen, shining and clean.’ The fine linen means the good things God’s people have done."]], [["The angel said to me, ‘Write this: God blesses those who are called to come to the wedding feast of the Lamb.’ And he said to me, ‘These are the true words of God.’"]], [["Then I kneeled down in front of him to worship him. But he said to me, ‘You must not do that! I am only a servant like you and like your brothers who tell about Jesus. Worship God! Those who tell about Jesus have the spirit of a prophet.’"]], [["Then I saw heaven open, and I saw a white horse! The One who rode him is called ‘One who can be Trusted’ and ‘The True One’. He punishes and makes war in the right way."]], [["His eyes were like a flame of fire. On his head were many crowns. He had a name written on him, but no man knew what it was but he himself."]], [["He wore clothes that had been dipped in blood. His name is ‘The Word of God’."]], [["The armies of heaven followed him on white horses and they were dressed in fine linen, shining and clean."]], [["A long knife or sword comes from his mouth. With it he will punish and control the people of the nations. He will rule them with an iron stick. He is like the winepress that presses the water out of the fruit. It is the place where God, who has all power, shows his great anger."]], [["A name is written on his clothes and on his leg: it is King of kings, and Lord of lords."]], [["I saw an angel standing in the sun. He called in a loud voice to all the birds that fly across the sky. He said, ‘Come, gather for God’s big feast."]], [["Come to eat the bodies of kings, the bodies of captains, the bodies of strong men, the bodies of horses and those who ride them, the bodies of all free men and of slaves, those who are great and those who are not great.’"]], [["I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies. They were gathered to fight against the One riding the horse and his army."]], [["Then the beast was caught and the prophet who is not true was caught. The prophet had done big works for the beast to see. By the things which he did, he had fooled the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshipped its idol. The beast and the prophet were thrown alive into the big fire which burns with dust that chokes people."]], [["Their armies were killed by the man riding the horse. He killed them with the sword that came out of his mouth. All the birds ate all they wanted of their dead bodies."]]], [[["Then I saw an angel coming down from the sky. In his hand he had the key to the big hole that has no bottom, and a big chain."]], [["He caught the dragon, that old snake who is called the devil and Satan. The angel tied him for a thousand years."]], [["Then the angel threw him into the big hole that has no bottom. He shut it and locked him in. He did this so that the devil would not fool the nations again until the end of the thousand years. After that, the devil will be let free for a short time."]], [["Then I saw thrones. Those who sat on them were given the right to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had their heads cut off because they told about Jesus and God’s word. They had not worshipped the beast or its idol. And they had not taken its mark on their foreheads or on their hands. They became alive again and ruled with Christ for a thousand years."]], [["The other dead people did not live again until the end of the thousand years. This is the first rising from death."]], [["God has blessed those who rise this first time, and they are holy. They will not die the second kind of death. But they will be priests of God and of Christ. They will rule with him for the thousand years."]], [["When the end of the thousand years comes, Satan will be set free from his prison."]], [["He will go out to fool the nations all over the world. He will fool Gog and Magog. He will gather them to fight. They are many, as many as the sand on the seashore."]], [["They marched far over the earth. They went all around the camp of God’s people and the city his people loved. Then fire came down from the sky and burned them."]], [["The devil who fooled them was thrown into the big fire which burns with dust that chokes people. The animal, and the prophet who is not true, were already in the fire. They will have a very hard time day and night, for ever and ever."]], [["Then I saw a big white throne and the person sitting on it. The earth and sky went away from him. They were not there any more."]], [["I saw the dead people, those who were great and those not great. They were standing in front of God’s throne. Some books were opened. And another book was opened which is the book of life. The dead people were judged by the things they had done, which were written in the books."]], [["The dead people in the sea came out. People came out of death and the world of the dead. One by one, each one was judged by the things he had done."]], [["Then death and the world of the dead were thrown into the big fire. This fire is the second death."]], [["Every person whose name was not written in the book of life was thrown into this big fire."]]], [[["Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and the first earth had gone away. There was no sea any more."]], [["I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. It was all ready and waiting, like a woman dressed for her wedding and ready to meet her husband."]], [["I heard a loud voice in heaven. It said, ‘Look! God’s house is now set up among the people. God will live with them. They will be his people and God himself will be with them."]], [["He will wipe every tear from their eyes. No one will die. No one will ever cry or be sad for any reason. No one will ever have trouble. The old things are gone.’"]], [["The One who sat on the throne said, ‘Look, I make all things new.’ And he said, ‘Write this, because these words can be trusted. They are true.’"]], [["He said to me, ‘It is finished! I am the First and the Last! I am the Beginning and the End. I will give the river of water that gives life to those who are thirsty. It will cost no money."]], [["The one who wins will have these things. I will be his God and he will be my son."]], [["Some people will be thrown into the big fire which burns with sulphur dust that chokes people. These are the people: those who give in to fear, those who do not believe, those who are bad, those who kill, those with wrong ways of using sex, the witch-doctors, those who worship idols, and all those who love lies. That fire is the second death.’"]], [["Then one of the seven angels who carried the seven bowls full of the last troubles came and talked to me. He said, ‘Come, I will show you the young woman who is the wife of the Lamb.’"]], [["The angel took me away in the Spirit to a very big hill. He showed me Jerusalem, the holy city, coming down out of heaven from God."]], [["The light of God was shining from it. It was bright like a very fine stone called jasper. It was as clear as glass."]], [["The city had a wall that was big and high. It had twelve doors. At the doors were twelve angels. Names were written on the doors. They are the names of the twelve tribes of the people of Israel."]], [["There were three doors on the east side. There were three doors on the north side. There were three doors on the south side and three doors on the west side."]], [["The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones. On them were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."]], [["The angel who talked to me had a gold stick to measure the city, its doors, and its walls."]], [["The city is square. It is as long as it is wide. The angel measured the city with his stick and it was about fifteen hundred miles. It is as long as it is wide and as high as it is long."]], [["Then he measured its wall. It was two hundred and sixteen feet by the way a man measures. That is the way the angel measured."]], [["The wall of the city was made of a very fine stone called jasper. The city was all made of pure gold. It was clear like glass."]], [["The bottom of the city wall was covered with all kinds of fine stones. The first stone was red jasper. The second stone was blue sapphire. The third stone was of many colours called agate. The fourth stone was green emerald."]], [["The fifth stone was onyx. The sixth stone was red carnelian. The seventh stone was green crysolite. The eighth stone was green beryl. The ninth stone was yellow topaz. The tenth stone was green chrysoprase. The eleventh stone was red jacinth.

It flows from the throne of God and the Lamb."]], [["It flows through the middle of the street of the city. On each side of the river is the tree which gives life.
